TI  - Positive cueing: Promoting sustainable consumer behavior by cueing common environmental behaviors as environmental
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract People frequently fail to see themselves as environmentally conscious consumers; one reason for this is that they are oftentimes prone to dismissing their more common ecological behaviors (e.g., avoid littering) as non-diagnostic for that particular self-image. The cueing of commonly performed ecological behaviors as environmentally friendly (what we call positive cueing) renders both cued and non-cued common ecological behaviors more diagnostic for the inference of pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1). As a result, positive cueing increases the likelihood that people will see themselves as consumers who are concerned with the degree to which their behavior is environmentally responsible (Study 2). The cueing of common ecological behaviors leads participants to choose environmentally friendly products with greater frequency, and even to use scrap paper more efficiently (Study 3). We discuss the implications for effective social marketing campaigns.

TI  - Does Changing a Light Bulb Lead to Changing the World? Political Action and the Conscious Consumer
PY  - 2012
AB  - As the prevalence of “conscious” consumption has grown, questions have arisen about its relationship to political action. An influential argument holds that political consumption individualizes responsibility for environmental degradation and “crowds out” genuine forms of activism. While European and Canadian empirical research contradicts this perspective, finding that conscious consumption and political engagement are positively connected, no studies of this relationship have been conducted for the United States. This article presents ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models for two datasets, the 2004 General Social Survey and a detailed survey of approximately 2,200 conscious consumers conducted by the authors, to assess the nature of the relationship between conscious consumption and political activism. The authors find that measures of conscious consumption are significantly and positively related to political action, even when controlling for political involvement in the past. The results sugg...

TI  - Maintenance and Decay of Past Behavior Influences: Anchoring Attitudes on Beliefs Following Inconsistent Actions
PY  - 2005
AB  - Three studies investigated the influence of past behavior on the stability of the attitudes it elicits. In Experiment 1, the effect of a bogus behavior feedback was long lasting when people engaged in biased scanning, presumably because this process elicits behavior-consistent beliefs. In contrast, the effect of the feedback decayed when participants were forced to consider whether the behavior might have undesirable outcomes. A second experiment using a different behavioral paradigm and a field study further supported the interpretation that individuals resolve conflict between a past behavior and subsequent beliefs about it by aligning attitudes with beliefs instead of behavior.

TI  - I Am What I Am, by Looking Past the Present: The Influence of Biospheric Values and Past Behavior on Environmental Self-Identity
PY  - 2013
AB  - A strong environmental self-identity increases the likelihood of a wide range of proenvironmental actions. But which factors influence identity and can we strengthen it? We propose that the environmental self-identity depends on biospheric values and on past behavior and that the strength of one’s environmental self-identity can be changed somewhat by reminding people of their past environmental behavior. We tested our model in a series of studies and show that biospheric values and past environmental behavior influence the environmental self-identity, which is in turn related to subsequent environmental judgments and intentions. Furthermore, we found that although the strength of the environmental self-identity changed when we reminded people of their past environmental actions, biospheric values remained an important predictor of self-identity, suggesting that the environmental self-identity has a stable core. Our results further suggest that environmental-friendly behavior can be promoted by reminding people of their past proenvironmental actions as this will strengthen one’s environmental self-identity.

TI  - Green identity, green living? The role of pro-environmental self-identity in determining consistency across diverse pro-environmental behaviours
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Policy-makers are interested in cost-effective and socially acceptable ways of encouraging the public to adopt more environmentally-friendly lifestyles. One area which UK policy-makers are focussing on is ‘catalyst behaviour’, the notion that taking-up a new behaviour (such as recycling) may cause people to adopt other pro-environmental behaviours. Yet, evidence for such ‘spill-over’ effects is so far limited, and it is unclear when and how cross-situational motivations (e.g., pro-environmental identity) may predict behaviour and when contextual factors are more important. We report on a postal survey ( N  = 551) of pro-environmental behaviours amongst the UK public. We assess the influence of pro-environmental self-identify on consistency across a range of behaviours. Pro-environmental values, perceived behavioural control, subjective norm, attitudes, and demographic factors were also measured. Findings show self-identity to be a significant behavioural determinant over and above theory of planned behaviour variables for carbon offsetting behaviour. However, pro-environmental self-identity was only a significant predictor for certain other pro-environmental behaviours; background variables were also important predictors. Limitations of the study, and implications for theory and policy, are discussed.

TI  - Does green consumerism increase the acceptance of wind power
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract In this paper, we discuss what might be termed an action-based learning approach to promoting important pro-environmental actions, such as support for or acceptance of environmental policy. Such an approach involves promoting simple and easy behaviours as entry points for more radical steps towards sustainability, referred to as “catalytic” or “wedge” behaviours. Despite the obvious need for innovative approaches to promote important pro-environmental behaviour, and sound theoretical backing for such concepts, there is a lack of research testing the key propositions of this approach. In a survey study based on a random sample of residents of the state of Maine, USA, we find that both everyday “green” behaviour and the acceptance of an expansion of wind power are rooted in environmental concern and that everyday “green” behaviour gives a significant contribution to predicting acceptance of wind power when controlling for environmental concern. Hence, the promotion of everyday “green” behaviours may prepare the grounds for increasing acceptance of more far-reaching changes in the population, such as an expansion of wind power.

TI  - Positive and negative spillover effects from electric car purchase to car use
PY  - 2013
AB  - This study reports the results of two online surveys conducted on buyers of conventional combustion engine cars compared to those of electric vehicles in Norway. The results show that electric cars are generally purchased as additional cars, do not contribute to a decrease in annual mileage if the old car is not substituted, and that electric car buyers use the car more often for their everyday mobility. Psychological determinants derived from the theory of planned behavior and the norm-activation theory show a high correlation between the purchase and use stages. Electric car buyers, have lower scores on many determinants of car use, especially awareness of consequences and close determinants of car use.

TI  - Do Green Products Make Us Better People
PY  - 2010
AB  - Consumer choices reflect not only price and quality preferences but also social and moral values, as witnessed in the remarkable growth of the global market for organic and environmentally friendly products. Building on recent research on behavioral priming and moral regulation, we found that mere exposure to green products and the purchase of such products lead to markedly different behavioral consequences. In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, results showed that people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green products than after mere exposure to conventional products. However, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products than after purchasing conventional products. Together, our studies show that consumption is connected to social and ethical behaviors more broadly across domains than previously thought.

TI  - Social Labeling and the Foot-in-the-Door Effect
PY  - 1982
AB  - Summary The foot-in-the-door procedure, first experimentally proposed by Freedman and Fraser, increases compliance for a critical request by preceding it with an easier request. Self-perception theory has frequently been used to explain why the procedure is effective. Labeling of an individual's behavior by others also may influence that individual's self-concept. The present study combined a labeling technique with the foot-in-the-door procedure to see whether compliance would be altered. An easy request was first asked of individuals entering a university library, and after answering they were informed that their response was either helpful or not helpful. Control conditions were also carried out. With 120 university students serving as Ss, the results showed that a positive label produced significantly greater compliance, and a negative label produced significantly lower compliance, when compared to the typical (nonlabel) foot-in-the-door procedure.

TI  - The ironic impact of activists: Negative stereotypes reduce social change influence
PY  - 2013
AB  - Despite recognizing the need for social change in areas such as social equality and environmental protection, individuals often avoid supporting such change. Researchers have previously attempted to understand this resistance to social change by examining individuals' perceptions of social issues and social change. We instead examined the possibility that individuals resist social change because they have negative stereotypes of activists, the agents of social change. Participants had negative stereotypes of activists (feminists and environmentalists), regardless of the domain of activism, viewing them as eccentric and militant. Furthermore, these stereotypes reduced participants' willingness to affiliate with ‘typical’ activists and, ultimately, to adopt the behaviours that these activists promoted. These results indicate that stereotypes and person perception processes more generally play a key role in creating resistance to social change. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Pro-environmental actions, climate change, and defensiveness: do self-affirmations make a difference to people's motives and beliefs about making a difference?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Social concerns with the imperative of environmentally sustainable life-styles sit rather awkwardly with ideas about the widespread denial of global environmental problems. Given the very obvious threat and denial dimensions to these issues, we conducted two studies assessing the impact of self-affirmation manipulations on people's beliefs and motives regarding pro-environmental actions. In Study 1, participants (N =125) completed a self-affirmation task and read information on the threat of climate change. Results showed that the self-affirmation manipulation resulted in lower levels of denial and greater perceptions of personal involvement in relation to climate change. In Study 2, participants (N =90) completed a self-affirmation task and read some information on recycling. Findings showed a beneficial effect of a self-affirmation manipulation on intentions to increase recycling behaviour (among lower recyclers). The results are discussed in relation to the potential benefits of self-affirmation manipulations for promoting pro-environmental actions

PY  - 2008
AB  - Hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. Mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. Methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. We provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. We present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. We also provide SAS and SPSS macros, as well as Mplus and LISREL syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.

TI  - Experiences of pride, not guilt, predict pro-environmental behavior when pro-environmental descriptive norms are more positive
PY  - 2016
AB  - Emotions can greatly influence behavior, yet research on links between incidental emotions and pro-environmental behavior is limited. The present study uses an experience sampling design to examine how pride and guilt relate to daily pro-environmental behavior. Ninety-six university students recorded their engagement in specific pro-environmental behaviors, and their feelings of pride and guilt about these behaviors, at four time points each day for three consecutive days. Results showed that pro-environmental behavior during a 2.5-h time period was positively related to pride, and negatively related to guilt, during that same time period. Pride about environmental behavior was positively related to subsequent engagement in pro-environmental behavior (i.e., during the following 2.5-h time period), but only for people who perceived more positive pro-environmental descriptive norms. Guilt was not related to subsequent pro-environmental behavior. We discuss implications for further research on the complex associations between daily experiences of moral emotions and pro-environmental behavior.

TI  - Whatever people say I am, that's what I am: Social labeling as a social marketing tool
PY  - 2007
AB  - In this paper, we present a procedure to apply the social labeling technique as a social marketing tool. Four studies indicate that communicating a social label, following an environmentally friendly behavior that is not motivated by pro-environmental concerns, leads consumers to re-attribute that behavior as representing their own environmental concern. Subsequently, they are likely to act upon their resulting self-perception as an environmentally friendly person. Social labeling is more successful when cognitive resources are distracted, either at the moment of processing the label or at the moment of making decisions related to the content of the label.

TI  - Environmental Sustainability and Behavioral Science: Meta-Analysis of Proenvironmental Behavior Experiments
PY  - 2011
AB  - To provide practitioners with useful information about how to promote proenvironmental behavior (PEB), a meta-analysis was performed on 87 published reports containing 253 experimental treatments that measured an observed, not self-reported, behavioral outcome. Most studies combined multiple treatments, and this confounding precluded definitive conclusions about which individual treatments are most effective. Treatments that included cognitive dissonance, goal setting, social modeling, and prompts provided the overall largest effect sizes (Hedge’s g > 0.60). Further analyses indicated that different treatments have been more effective for certain behaviors. Although average effect sizes are based on small numbers of studies, effective combinations of treatments and behaviors are making it easy to recycle, setting goals for conserving gasoline, and modeling home energy conservation. The results also reveal several gaps in the literature that should guide further research, including both treatments and PEB ...

TI  - The value of environmental self-identity: The relationship between biospheric values, environmental self-identity and environmental preferences, intentions and behaviour
PY  - 2013
AB  - Biospheric values and environmental self-identities are considered to be important antecedents of environmental preferences, intentions, and behaviour. Although various authors suggest a relationship between values and self-identity, this has rarely been studied empirically. This paper aimed to clarify the relationship between biospheric values and environmental self-identity and to study how both are related to environmental preferences, intentions, and behaviour. We hypothesized that biospheric values are related to environmental self-identity, and that self-identity is in turn related to preferences, intentions, and behaviour. Results of three studies including a wide range of environmental preferences, intentions, and behaviour support our reasoning and show that biospheric values are related to environmental self-identity, even when measured months before. Moreover, we found that the relationship between biospheric values and environmental preferences, intentions and behaviour was fully mediated by environmental self-identity, indicating that biospheric values are related to preferences, intentions, and behaviour via one's environmental self-identity. This suggests that values need to be linked to the self in order to be influential in choices made.

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Incentives and Labeling on the Foot-in-the-Door Effect: Evidence for a Self-Perception Process
PY  - 2003
AB  - We tested the self-perception explanation of the foot-in-the-door effect by manipulating self-perceived helpfulness and assessing self-concept. Participants given $1 to sign a homelessness petition were less likely to see themselves as altruistic than participants not given the monetary incentive. The paid participants also complied less often with a request to work on a canned food drive 2 days later than unpaid participants. In contrast, participants told they were helpful individuals were more likely to see themselves as altruistic and were more likely to volunteer for the food drive than unlabeled participants. Mediation analyses provide evidence that changes in self-concept underlie a successful foot-in-the-door manipulation and support the self-perception explanation for the foot-in-the-door effect.

TI  - Going green to be seen: Status, reputation, and conspicuous conservation.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Why do people purchase proenvironmental "green" products? We argue that buying such products can be construed as altruistic, since green products often cost more and are of lower quality than their conventional counterparts, but green goods benefit the environment for everyone. Because biologists have observed that altruism might function as a "costly signal" associated with status, we examined in 3 experiments how status motives influenced desire for green products. Activating status motives led people to choose green products over more luxurious nongreen products. Supporting the notion that altruism signals one's willingness and ability to incur costs for others' benefit, status motives increased desire for green products when shopping in public (but not private) and when green products cost more (but not less) than nongreen products. Findings suggest that status competition can be used to promote proenvironmental behavior.

TI  - Communicating Nature: How We Create and Understand Environmental Messages
PY  - 2006
AB  - A broader and more comprehensive understanding of how we communicate with each other about the natural world and our relationship to it is essential to solving environmental problems. How do individuals develop beliefs and ideologies about the environment? How do we express those beliefs through communication? How are we influenced by the messages of pop culture and social institutions? And how does all this communication become part of the larger social fabric of what we know as "the environment"? "Communicating Nature" explores and explains the multiple levels of everyday communication that come together to form our perceptions of the natural world. Author, Julia B. Corbett considers all levels of communication, from the individual level, to environmental messages transmitted by popular culture, to communication generated by social institutions, including political and regulatory agencies, business and corporations, media outlets, and educational and religious organizations. The book offers a fresh and engaging introductory look at a topic of broad interest, and is an important work for students of the environment, activists, and professionals interested in understanding the cultural context of human-nature interactions.

TI  - It is a moral issue: The relationship between environmental self-identity, obligation-based intrinsic motivation and pro-environmental behaviour
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract In order to effectively mitigate climate change, people need to adopt environmentally-friendly actions. We argue that some people act in an environmentally-friendly manner without external incentives to do so, but rather because they are intrinsically motivated to do so. There is some initial evidence to suggest that this is particularly likely for people with a strong environmental self-identity. However, not much is known about how environmental self-identity influences pro-environmental actions. In this research, we aimed to test whether, and if so, via which process environmental self-identity is related to environmentally-friendly behaviour. We conducted three studies to test our hypotheses. In the first study, our hypotheses were confirmed in a sample of the general population using a correlational design. In the second study, we replicated our findings with a different indicator of moral obligation and with a different dependent variable. In the third study, we tested our model in an experimental design. Again, we found support for our hypotheses that environmental self-identity is related to one's obligation-based intrinsic motivation (that is, feelings of moral obligation) to act pro-environmentally, which in turn affects pro-environmental actions. As expected, the obligation-based intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between environmental self-identity and environmentally-friendly behaviour. Our findings suggest that strengthening environmental self-identity may be a cost-effective way to promote pro-environmental actions, as people with a strong environmental self-identity are likely to act in an environmentally-friendly manner without an external incentive to do so.

When are past pro-environmental actions likely to lead to more environmentally-friendly behaviour? We propose this depends on the extent to which initial actions are linked to people's environmental self-identity. We hypothesise that past pro-environmental actions are more likely to influence one's environmental self-identity when the behaviour implies something about you. As expected, environmental self-identity was stronger when the initial behaviour more strongly signals that you are a pro-environmental person. The signalling strength of previous pro-environmental actions was high when people considered a wide range of past pro-environmental actions, or when the initial behaviour was difficult and unique. Our results suggest that pro-environmental behaviour can be promoted by reminding people of their past pro-environmental actions, particularly when these actions strongly signal that one is a pro-environmental person, thereby strengthening environmental self-identity.

TI  - Using Cognitive Dissonance to Encourage Water Conservation)
PY  - 1992
AB  - In a field experiment on water conservation, we aroused dissonance in patrons of the campus recreation facility by making them feel hypocritical about their showering habits. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we manipulated subjects “‘mindfulness” that they had sometimes wasted water while showering, and then varied whether they made a “public commitment” urging other people to take shorter showers. The “hypocrisy” condition-in which subjects made the public commitment after being reminded of their past behavior-was expected to be dissonance-arousing, thereby motivating subjects to increase their efforts to conserve water. The results were consistent with this reasoning. Compared to controls, subjects in the hypocrisy condition took significantly shorter showers. Subjects who were merely reminded that they had wasted water, or who only made the public commitment, did not take shorter showers than control subjects. The findings have implications for using cognitive dissonance as means of changing behavior in applied settings, especially those in which people already support the desired goal, but their behavior is not consistent with those beliefs.

TI  - Attribution versus persuasion as a means for modifying behavior.
PY  - 1975
AB  - The present research compared the relative effectiveness of an attribution strategy with a persuasion strategy in changing behavior. Study 1 attempted to teach fifth graders not to litter and to clean up after others. An attribution group was repeatedly told that they were neat and tidy people, a persuasion group was repeatedly told that they should be neat and tidy, and a control group received no treatment. Attribution proved considerably more effective in modifying behavior. Study 2 tried to discover whether similar effects would hold for a more central aspect of school performance, math achievement and self-esteem, and whether an attribution of ability would be as effective as an attribution of motivation. Repeatedly attributing to second graders either the ability or the motivation to do well in math proved more effective than comparable persuasion or no-treatment control groups, although a group receiving straight reinforcement for math problem-solving behavior also did well. It is suggested that persuasion often suffers because it involves a negative attribution (a person should be what he is not), while attribution generally gains because it disguises persuasive intent.

TI  - Simple and Painless? The Limitations of Spillover in Environmental Campaigning
PY  - 2009
AB  - The comfortable perception that global environmental challenges can be met through marginal lifestyle changes no longer bears scrutiny. The cumulative impact of large numbers of individuals making marginal improvements in their environmental impact will be a marginal collective improvement in environmental impact. Yet, we live at a time when we need urgent and ambitious changes. An appeal to environmental imperatives is more likely to lead to spillover into other pro-environmental behaviours than an appeal to financial self-interest or social status.

TI  - The introduction of a single-use carrier bag charge in Wales: Attitude change and behavioural spillover effects
PY  - 2013
AB  - Wales is the first country in the United Kingdom to have introduced a charge for single-use carrier bags. A 2x2 quasi-experimental field study was set up to evaluate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the charge. Independent nationally representative quota samples were interviewed before and after the introduction of the carrier bag charge in Wales and at the same times in England (n=500 each). England, where no carrier bag charge was introduced, served as the comparator for the study. The study found increases in own bag use in both countries. However, the increase was much greater in Wales than in England. The study also found evidence for the policy becoming more popular after its implementation in Wales. While support for the carrier bag charge was already high before its introduction, the Welsh population became even more supportive afterwards. Although no support was found for positive behavioural spillover, the study found changes in self-reported environmental identity that could produce positive spillover effects in the longer term. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Individualization: Plant a Tree, Buy a Bike, Save the World?
PY  - 2001
AB  - An increasingly dominant, largely American response to the contemporary environmental crisis understands environmental degradation as the product of individual shortcomings and finds solutions in enlightened, uncoordinated consumer choice. Several forces promote this process of individualization, including the historical baggage of mainstream environmentalism, the core tenets of liberalism, the dynamic ability of capitalism to commodify dissent, and the relatively recent rise of global environmental threats to human prosperity. The result is to narrow our collective ability to imagine and pursue a variety of productive responses to the environmental problems before us. When responsibility for environmental problems is individualized, there is little room to ponder institutions, the nature and exercise of political power, or ways of collectively changing the distribution of power and influence in society. Confronting consumption requires individuals to understand themselves not primarily as consumers but r...

TI  - The Importance of Being Green: The Influence of Green Behaviors on Americans’ Political Attitudes Toward Climate Change
PY  - 2014
AB  - Two studies investigated whether performing green behaviors may influence people’s political attitudes regarding climate change. A survey study revealed that self-reported green behaviors indirectly predicted American participants’ political attitudes regarding climate change, and that this relationship was mediated by their green self-perceptions. This relationship was relatively stronger for conservatives than for liberals. An experimental study included two conditions: one which led people to perceive that they often performed green behaviors and another that led them to perceive that they failed to perform green behaviors. Political-orientation was found to moderate the effect of green behavior perceptions on ratings of the importance of climate-related issues and on support for emissions-reducing policies. Liberals reported greater importance and greater policy support when perceiving that they failed to act green, while conservatives did not. Implications for green behavior campaigns and their polit...

TI  - Promoting or Jeopardizing Lighter Carbon Footprints? Self-Affirmation Can Polarize Environmental Orientations
PY  - 2012
AB  - Research has shown that self-affirmation often leads to more adaptive responses to messages that focus on behavior-specific, individual threats. However, little is known about the effects of self-affirmation in the context of an ongoing collective threat, such as climate change. In the study reported here (N ¼ 90), the authors examined whether self-affirmation might polarize orientations toward environment-related actions when people rely on their established beliefs about climate change. The authors found that self-affirmation led to more constructive pro-environmental motives among participants with positive ecological worldviews but led to less constructive pro-environmental motives among participants with negative ecological worldviews. These findings suggest that in the absence of a persuasive threatening message, self-affirmation might serve to validate a person’s initial worldviews about environmental issues.

TI  - Four Facts About ESG Beliefs and Investor Portfolios
PY  - 2023
AB  - We analyze survey data on ESG beliefs and preferences in a large panel of retail investors linked to administrative data on their investment portfolios.The survey elicits investors' expectations of long-term ESG equity returns and asks about their motivations, if any, to invest in ESG assets.We document four facts.First, investors generally expected ESG investments to underperform the market.Between mid-2021 and late-2022, the average expected 10-year annualized return of ESG investments relative to the overall stock market was -1.4%.Second, there is substantial heterogeneity across investors in their ESG return expectations and their motives for ESG investing: 45% of survey respondents do not see any reason to invest in ESG, 25% are primarily motivated by ethical considerations, 22% are driven by climate hedging motives, and 7% are motivated by return expectations.Third, there is a link between individuals' reported ESG investment motives and their actual investment behaviors, with the highest ESG portfolio holdings among individuals who report ethics-driven investment motives.Fourth, financial considerations matter independently of other investment motives: we find meaningful ESG holdings only for investors who expect these investments to outperform the market, even among those investors who reported that their most important ESG investment motives were ethical or hedging reasons.

TI  - Why do investors hold socially responsible mutual funds
PY  - 2017
AB  - To understand why investors hold socially responsible mutual funds, we link administrative data to survey responses and behavior in incentivized experiments. We find that both social preferences and social signaling explain socially responsible investment (SRI) decisions. Financial motives play less of a role. Socially responsible investors in our sample expect to earn lower returns on SRI funds than on conventional funds and pay higher management fees. This suggests that investors are willing to forgo financial performance in order to invest in accordance with their social preferences.

TI  - The Misguided Beliefs of Financial Advisors
PY  - 2020
AB  - A common view of retail finance is that conflicts of interest contribute to the high cost of advice. Within a large sample of Canadian financial advisors and their clients, however, we show that advisors typically invest personally just as they advise their clients. Advisors trade frequently, chase returns, prefer expensive and actively managed funds, and underdiversify. Advisors' net returns of −3% per year are similar to their clients' net returns. Advisors do not strategically hold expensive portfolios only to convince clients to do the same; they continue to do so after they leave the industry.

TI  - Altruism and egoism in investment decisions
PY  - 2019
AB  - We provide survey evidence that personal values have an impact on individual investment decisions, in particular the decision to invest socially responsible. Our findings show that there is a positive link between altruistic values and the relative importance of social responsibility. This effect is stronger when individuals believe that they can make a positive social or environmental impact with their investments, or when they feel morally obliged to invest responsibly. If altruistic individuals associate responsible investments with higher returns, it decreases their motivation to invest responsibly. Egoistic values are negatively associated with the decision to invest responsibly, unless individuals associate responsible investing with higher returns.

TI  - Investment Strategies and Corporate Behaviour with Socially Responsible Investors: A Theory of Active Ownership
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Socially responsible investors constitute an important force in today's global financial markets. This paper examines conditions under which socially responsible investors induce companies to behave responsibly. We develop an asset pricing model in which some shareholders are active owners, that is, they engage companies by voting on strategic decisions. Differences of objective among shareholders arise because socially responsible investors value corporate externalities. In our baseline model, we show that a firm may choose a responsible strategy even if the majority of investors are not responsible. We also demonstrate that such a choice of a responsible strategy might be fragile because it might depend on investors' self‐fulfilling beliefs. We then extend our baseline model to analyse the link between divestment and engagement strategies, the case with multiple firms, the role of benefit corporation charters, and the impact of a large investor.</jats:p>

We demonstrate this effect by exploiting the introduction of capital guarantee products in Sweden between 2002 and 2007. Their fast and broad adoption is associated with an increase in expected financial portfolio returns. The effect is especially strong for households with low‐risk appetite ex ante. These empirical facts are consistent with a life‐cycle model in which households have pessimistic beliefs or preferences combining loss aversion and narrow framing. Our results illustrate how security design can mitigate behavioral biases to increase mean household portfolio returns.</jats:p>

We then discuss household choices in insurance markets, trading behavior, decisions on retirement saving, and financial choices by retirees. We survey research on liabilities, including mortgage choice, refinancing, and default, and household behavior in unsecured credit markets, including credit cards and payday lending. We then connect the household to its social environment, including peer effects, cultural and hereditary factors, intra-household financial decision-making, financial literacy, cognition, and educational interventions. We also discuss literature on the provision and consumption of financial advice. (JEL D15, G41, G50, J26, Z13)</jats:p>

TI  - Financial literacy and stock market participation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Individuals are increasingly put in charge of their financial security after retirement. Moreover, the supply of complex financial products has increased considerably over the years. However, we still have little or no information about whether individuals have the financial knowledge and skills to navigate this new financial environment. To better understand financial literacy and its relation to financial decision-making, we have devised two special modules for the DNB Household Survey. We have designed questions to measure numeracy and basic knowledge related to the working of inflation and interest rates, as well as questions to measure more advanced financial knowledge related to financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, and mutual funds). We evaluate the importance of financial literacy by studying its relation to the stock market: Are more financially knowledgeable individuals more likely to hold stocks? To assess the direction of causality, we make use of questions measuring financial knowledge before investing in the stock market. We find that, while the understanding of basic economic concepts related to inflation and interest rate compounding is far from perfect, it outperforms the limited knowledge of stocks and bonds, the concept of risk diversification, and the working of financial markets. We also find that the measurement of financial literacy is very sensitive to the wording of survey questions. This provides additional evidence for limited financial knowledge. Finally, we report evidence of an independent effect of financial literacy on stock market participation: Those who have low financial literacy are significantly less likely to invest in stocks.

TI  - Global Evidence on Economic Preferences
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper studies the global variation in economic preferences. For this purpose, we present the Global Preference Survey (GPS), an experimentally validated survey dataset of time preference, risk preference, positive and negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust from 80,000 individuals in 76 countries. The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and bio-geographic and cultural variables such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labor market choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.

TI  - Citizens show strong support for climate policy, but are they also willing to pay?
PY  - 2017
AB  - To what extent citizens are willing not only to support ambitious climate policy but also willing to pay for such policy remains subject to debate. Our analysis addresses three issues in this regard: whether, as is widely assumed but not empirically established, willingness to support (WTS) is higher than willingness to pay (WTP); whether the determinants of the two are similar; and what accounts for within-subject similarity between WTS and WTP. We address these issues based on data from an original nationally representative survey (N = 2500) on forest conservation in Brazil, arguably the key climate policy issue in the country. The findings reveal that WTP is much lower than WTS. The determinants differ to some extent as well, regarding the effects of age, gender, and trust in government. The analysis also provides insights into factors influencing how much WTS and WTP line up within individuals, with respect to age, education, political ideology, salience of the deforestation issue, and trust in government. Our findings provide a more nuanced picture of how strong public support for climate change policy is and a starting point for more targeted climate policy communication.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We model investing that considers environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. In equilibrium, green assets have low expected returns because investors enjoy holding them and because green assets hedge climate risk. Green assets nevertheless outperform when positive shocks hit the ESG factor, which captures shifts in customers’ tastes for green products and investors’ tastes for green holdings. The ESG factor and the market portfolio price assets in a two-factor model. The ESG investment industry is largest when investors’ ESG preferences differ most. Sustainable investing produces positive social impact by making firms greener and by shifting real investment toward green firms.

TI  - Does education increase pro-environmental behavior? Evidence from Europe
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract It is often observed that individuals with higher education levels tend to be more environmentally friendly. Yet, the causal evidence is lacking because there may well be omitted variables that cause individuals to attain more education and also cause individuals to be environmentally conscious. We implement a regression discontinuity design to estimate the increase in educational attainment due to changes in compulsory education laws in 20th century Europe. This allows us to overcome the identification problem of endogenous educational attainment. Using two waves of Eurobarometer surveys, we find a positive local average treatment effect for 7 of the 8 pro-environmental behaviors. An analysis of related questions on the survey supports the notion that education causes individuals to be more concerned with social welfare and to accordingly behave in a more environmentally friendly manner.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Green assets delivered high returns in recent years. This performance reflects unexpectedly strong increases in environmental concerns, not high expected returns. German green bonds outperformed their higher-yielding non-green twins as the “greenium” widened, and U.S. green stocks outperformed brown as climate concerns strengthened. Despite that outperformance, we estimate lower expected returns for green stocks than for brown, consistent with theory. We estimate expected returns in two ways: ex ante, using implied costs of capital, and ex post, using realized returns purged of shocks from climate concerns and earnings. A theoretically motivated green factor explains much of value stocks’ recent underperformance.

Many of the investors, especially the long-term, larger, and ESG-oriented ones, consider risk management and engagement, rather than divestment, to be the better approach for addressing climate risks. Although surveyed investors believe that some equity valuations do not fully reflect climate risks, their perceived overvaluations are not large.

TI  - Investment Barriers and Labeling Schemes for Socially Responsible Investments
PY  - 2020
AB  - Given the increasing role of socially responsible investing (SRI), but still limited participation of individual (i.e. small, retail) investors, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) We aim to identify investment barriers regarding SRI for individual investors and analyze to what extent these barriers vary across different investor groups. (ii) We analyze to what extent sustainability or transparency labels can help to overcome these barriers. To this end, we empirically analyze data from a survey and a stated choice experiment for a broad sample of financial decision makers in German households. The results suggest that a considerable amount of respondents can imagine to invest in a socially responsible manner, which is promising for policymakers and practitioners who aim to foster sustainable development and SRI. However, too high information costs are a severe barrier for potential future investors and a considerable share of respondents distrusts providers of socially responsible investment products. Banks, who could help to solve this problem, appear not to fulfill their role as intermediaries. But we find that labels might serve as a complement to banks. Especially sustainability certificates that confirm the consideration of sustainability criteria could decrease information costs and overcome at least some barriers for some investor groups, particularly for new investors. However, the results also suggest that a certain degree of basic knowledge and trust in providers of socially responsible investment products is required before labels work efficiently.

TI  - Responsible Investing: The ESG-efficient Frontier
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We propose a theory in which each stock's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score plays two roles: (1) providing information about firm fundamentals and (2) affecting investor preferences. The solution to the investor's portfolio problem is characterized by an ESG-efficient frontier, showing the highest attainable Sharpe ratio for each ESG level. The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation. Equilibrium asset prices are determined by an ESG-adjusted capital asset pricing model, showing when ESG raises or lowers the required return. Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical ESG-efficient frontier and show the costs and benefits of responsible investing. Finally, we test our theory's predictions using proxies for E (carbon emissions), S, G, and overall ESG.

TI  - The Impact of Social Investing on Charitable Donations
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p> We examine the impact of social investing on charitable donations using a unique data set consisting of investment behaviors and donation transactions for more than 10,000 customers of an investment app platform. We find that investors switching to a recently introduced social fund reduced their donations, mainly in charities supporting causes similar to those of the social fund. However, 79% of the investors that switched to the social fund did not donate before switching, so the social fund attracted more people to fund social causes. Still, because of the substitution effect, we estimate social funds have a positive effect on society only if their annual contributions to social causes are greater than 3.2% of the balance invested. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This work was supported by the Henry Crown Institute of Business Research and the Jeremy Coller Foundation. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4339 . </jats:p>

TI  - Retail Financial Advice: Does One Size Fit All?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Using unique data on Canadian households, we assess the impact of financial advisors on their clients’ portfolios. We find that advisors induce their clients to take more risk, thereby raising expected returns. On the other hand, we find limited evidence of customization: advisors direct clients into similar portfolios independent of their clients’ risk preferences and stage in the life cycle. An advisor’s own portfolio is a good predictor of the client’s portfolio even after controlling for the client’s characteristics. This one-size-fits-all advice does not come cheap. The average client pays more than 2.7% each year in fees and thus gives up all of the equity premium gained through increased risk-taking.

TI  - How Does Household Portfolio Diversification Vary with Financial Literacy and Financial Advice
PY  - 2015
AB  - Household investment mistakes are an important concern for researchers and policymakers alike. Portfolio underdiversification ranks among those mistakes that are potentially most costly. However, its roots and empirical importance are poorly understood. I estimate quantitatively meaningful diversification statistics and investigate their relationship with key variables. Nearly all households that score high on financial literacy or rely on professionals or private contacts for advice achieve reasonable investment outcomes. Compared to these groups, households with below-median financial literacy that trust their own decision-making capabilities lose an expected 50 bps on average. All group differences stem from the top of the loss distribution.

TI  - Household preferences for socially responsible investments
PY  - 2019
AB  - We analyze revealed and stated household preferences for socially responsible investments (SRI). Using a questionnaire specifically designed for this purpose and administered to a Dutch representative household panel, we investigate the actual and latent demand for SRI products. Respondents reported whether they owned SRI products and why or why not, but also answered stated choice questions on traditional investments and hypothetical socially responsible products with an explicit return penalty and/or an inkind compensation associated with lower return. Our results show that investors attracted by socially responsible financial products are more interested in the social product as such and show little interest in compensation. The magnitude of the penalty for investing in SRI is not diluting their investment intentions.

TI  - Awareness and Stock Market Participation
PY  - 2005
AB  - The paper documents lack of awareness of financial assets in the 1995 and 1998 Bank of Italy Surveys of Household Income and Wealth. It then explores the determinants of awareness, and finds that the probability that survey respondents are aware of stocks, mutual funds and investment accounts is positively correlated with education, household resources, long-term bank relations and proxies for social interaction. Lack of financial awareness has important implications for understanding the stockholding puzzle and for estimating stock market participation costs.

TI  - The Asymmetry in Responsible Investing Preferences
PY  - 2021
AB  - We design an experiment to understand how social preferences affect investment decisions through stock allocations and probability assessments. The major preference channel is asymmetric in social outcomes – although negative and positive responsible investment (RI) externalities have the same magnitudes, negative externalities have greater impact on investment choices. The effect is persistent, but heterogenous. We also find asymmetries in belief formation and learning constitute a secondary channel. Overall, our results are consistent with important stylized empirical facts and the predictions of recent RI theories that social preferences lead to different investment choices, but our analyses also suggest important future modeling directions.

TI  - Understanding Mechanisms Underlying Peer Effects: Evidence From a Field Experiment on Financial Decisions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Using a high‐stakes field experiment conducted with a financial brokerage, we implement a novel design to separately identify two channels of social influence in financial decisions, both widely studied theoretically. When someone purchases an asset, his peers may also want to purchase it, both because they learn from his choice (“social learning”) and because his possession of the asset directly affects others' utility of owning the same asset (“social utility”). We randomize whether one member of a peer pair who chose to purchase an asset has that choice implemented, thus randomizing his ability to possess the asset. Then, we randomize whether the second member of the pair: (i) receives no information about the first member, or (ii) is informed of the first member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no information) control group. We find that both social learning and social utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow‐up survey reveals that social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with “keeping up with the Joneses” when learning about their peer's possession of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in consumption and investment decisions.

TI  - The Handbook of News Analytics in Finance - All That Glitters: The Effect of Attention and News on the Buying Behavior of Individual and Institutional Investors
PY  - 2007
AB  - We test and confirm the hypothesis that individual investors are net buyers of attention-grabbing stocks, e.g., stocks in the news, stocks experiencing high abnormal trading volume, and stocks with extreme one-day returns. Attention-driven buying results from the difficulty that investors have searching the thousands of stocks they can potentially buy. Individual investors do not face the same search problem when selling because they tend to sell only stocks they already own. We hypothesize that many investors consider purchasing only stocks that have first caught their attention. Thus, preferences determine choices after attention has determined the choice set.

TI  - Exit versus Voice
PY  - 2022
AB  - We study the relative effectiveness of exit (divestment and boycott) and voice (engagement) strategies in a world where companies generate externalities and some agents care about the social impact of their decisions. We show that if the majority of investors are even slightly socially responsible, voice achieves the socially optimal outcome. In contrast, exit does not unless everybody is significantly socially responsible. If the majority of investors are purely selfish, exit is a more effective strategy, but neither strategy generally achieves the first best. We also show that exit can sometimes reduce social welfare.

TI  - Trusting the stock market
PY  - 2008
AB  - We study the effect that a general lack of trust can have on stock market participation. In deciding whether to buy stocks, investors factor in the risk of being cheated. The perception of this risk is a function of the objective characteristics of the stocks and the subjective characteristics of the investor. Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock and, conditional on buying stock, they will buy less. In Dutch and Italian micro data, as well as in cross-country data, we find evidence consistent with lack of trust being an important factor in explaining the limited participation puzzle. THE DECISION TO INVEST IN stocks requires not only an assessment of the risk‐ return trade-off given the existing data, but also an act of faith (trust) that the data in our possession are reliable and that the overall system is fair. Episodes like the collapse of Enron may change not only the distribution of expected payoffs, but also the fundamental trust in the system that delivers those payoffs. Most of us will not enter a three-card game played on the street, even after observing a lot of rounds (and thus getting an estimate of the “true” distribution of payoffs). The reason is that we do not trust the fairness of the game (and the person playing it). In this paper, we claim that for many people, especially people unfamiliar with finance, the stock market is not intrinsically different from the three-card game. They need to have trust in the fairness of the game and in the reliability of the numbers to invest in it. We focus on trust to explain differences in stock market participation across individuals and across countries. We define trust as the subjective probability individuals attribute to the possibility of being cheated. This subjective probability is partly based on objective

TI  - Higher Order Risk Attitudes, Demographics, and Financial Decisions
PY  - 2013
AB  - We conduct an experiment to study the prevalence of the higher order risk attitudes of prudence and temperance, in a large demographically representative sample, as well as in a sample of undergraduate students. Participants make pairwise choices between lotteries of the form proposed by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2006). The choices in these lotteries isolate prudent from imprudent, and temperate from intemperate, behavior. We relate individuals’ risk aversion, prudence, and temperance levels to demographics and financial decisions. We observe that the majority of individuals’ decisions are consistent with risk aversion, prudence, and temperance, in both the student and the demographically representative sample. An individual’s level of prudence is predictive of his wealth, saving, and borrowing behavior outside of the experiment, while temperance predicts the riskiness of portfolio choices. Our findings suggest that the coefficient of relative prudence for a representative individual is approximately equal to two.

TI  - Sustainable finance literacy and the determinants of sustainable investing
PY  - 2024
AB  - In this paper, we survey a large sample of Swiss households to measure sustainable finance literacy, which we define as the knowledge and skill of identifying and assessing financial products according to their reported sustainability-related characteristics. To this end, we use multiple-choice questions. Furthermore, we measure Swiss private investors' level of awareness about sustainable financial products using open-ended questions. We find that Swiss households, which are generally highly financially literate by international standards, exhibit low levels of sustainable financial literacy compared to the current working definitions of sustainable finance. Moreover, despite its low level, knowledge about sustainable finance is a significant factor in the reported ownership of sustainable products. The empirical results also show a relatively low level of awareness. Generally, these empirical findings suggest a need to create transparent regulatory standards and strengthen information campaigns about sustainable financial products.

TI  - Why Do Retail Investors Pick Green Investments? A Lab-in-the-Field Experiment with Crowdfunders
PY  - 2023
AB  - Do investors invest in green projects because they expect higher returns, to help the environment, or to help other people? To separate these motivations, we run a decision experiment in which crowdfunders choose between a higher return or a positive environmental impact, and between a higher return or a positive social impact. A majority of investors choose environmental and social impact over higher returns, conditional on large enough impact. Combining the experimental data with historical investments, we find that investors allocate a larger share of funds to green projects if they value environmental impact more and if they expect a higher return, but not if they value social impact more, all else equal. These findings suggest that investors have a preference for positive environmental impact, and satisfy it by investing in green projects. Finally, we introduce new survey measures of impact for future use, which are experimentally validated and predict field behavior.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Do people put their pension savings on the table to promote sustainability? We answer this question in a large-scale field experiment (n = 3,256). The pension fund in our study gave its members a real vote for more or less sustainable investments. A comparison group made the same decision, but hypothetically. We find that 66.7% of the participants favor to invest their pension savings in a sustainable manner. This choice is driven by social preferences. As a result of these strong social preferences we find no difference between the real and hypothetical treatment groups. We rule out financial beliefs, confusion, or a lack of information as explanation. Institutional investors benefit from taking their clients' social preferences seriously, with consequences for asset prices and the fulfillment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Stock-Return Ignorance
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract Optimal stock investment decisions rely on assessments of the distribution of expected returns. Using a representative sample, we find over half the US population cannot answer simple questions on expected stock returns. Respondents who are unable to make any return prediction, who cannot answer questions on the distribution of expected returns, or who reveal unlikely distributional beliefs participate less in the stock market and have smaller stock investments. However, overoptimistic investors are more likely to participate in the stock market and have larger stock investments. These results persist after controlling for financial literacy, intelligence, education, and demographics. People who are ignorant about stock return distribution are more likely to invest in equities if they have higher levels of trust. Therefore, trust can substitute for cognition as a factor positively associated with individuals’ propensity to invest.

TI  - Who takes Risks When and Why: Determinants of Changes in Investor Risk Taking*
PY  - 2012
AB  - We use data from a repeated survey panel that was run with real online broker customers in September 2008, December 2008, and March 2009. In all three surveys subjects' risk attitudes, risk expectations, return expectations, and risk taking behavior, i.e. the proportion of wealth they are willing to invest into the stock market compared to a risk free asset, were elicited. Using this unique dataset we analyze whether risk taking, risk attitudes, and expectations change from one quarter to the other and whether the latter two have an impact on risk taking behavior. Our results indicate that risk taking behavior decreases substantially from September to December and from December to March. Similarly, risk expectations and return expectations also change substantially from one survey to the next one. In contrast, various measures of risk attitudes are fairly stable over the time periods. Interestingly, observed changes in risk taking behavior can primarily be attributed to changes in risk and return expectations but not to changes in past performance or changes in risk attitudes. Moreover, our findings are valuable for practitioners - who are urged by MiFID (2006) to elicit their customers' risk profiles and risk preferences - since we show that risk attitudes remain fairly stable and that changes in investment behavior can mainly be attributed to changes in expectations. Lastly, we illustrate that overconfidence seems to be a fairly stable construct between September and December and tends to decrease slightly from December to March.

TI  - Noncognitive Abilities and Financial Distress: Evidence from a Representative Household Panel
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper provides evidence of how noncognitive abilities affect financial distress. In a representative panel of households, we find that people in the bottom quintile of noncognitive abilities are 10 times more likely to experience financial distress than those in the top quintile. We provide evidence that this relation largely arises from worse financial choices and lack of financial insight by low-ability individuals and reflects differential exposure to income shocks only to a lesser degree. We mitigate endogeneity concerns using an IV approach and an extensive set of controls. Implications for policy and finance research are discussed.Received September 24, 2017; editorial decision September 26, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.

TI  - Financial advisors: A case of babysitters?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract We use two data sets, one from a large brokerage and another from a major bank, to ask: (i) whether financial advisors are more likely to be matched with poorer, uninformed investors or with richer and experienced investors; (ii) how advised accounts actually perform relative to self-managed accounts; (iii) whether the contribution of independent and bank advisors is similar. We find that advised accounts offer on average lower net returns and inferior risk-return tradeoffs (Sharpe ratios). Trading costs contribute to outcomes, as advised accounts feature higher turnover, consistent with commissions being the main source of advisor income. Results are robust to controlling for investor and local area characteristics. The results apply with stronger force to bank advisors than to independent financial advisors, consistent with greater limitations on bank advisory services.

TI  - Consumption and Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle
PY  - 2005
AB  - This article solves a realistically calibrated life cycle model of consumption and portfolio choice with non-tradable labor income and borrowing constraints. Since labor income substitutes for riskless asset holdings, the optimal share invested in equities is roughly decreasing over life. We compute a measure of the importance of human capital for investment behavior. We find that ignoring labor income generates large utility costs, while the cost of ignoring only its risk is an order of magnitude smaller, except when we allow for a disastrous labor income shock. Moreover, we study the implications of introducing endogenous borrowing constraints in this incomplete-markets setting. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

TI  - Trust, Sociability, and Stock Market Participation
PY  - 2011
AB  - We investigate the effects of both trust and sociability for stock market participation, the role of which has been examined separately by existing finance literature. We use internationally comparable household data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe supplemented with regional information on generalized trust from the World Value Survey and on specific trust to financial institutions from Eurobarometer. We show that trust and sociability have distinct and sizeable positive effects on stock market participation and that sociability is likely to partly balance the discouragement effect on stockholding induced by low generalized trust in the region of residence. We also show that specific trust in advice given by financial institutions represents a prominent factor for stock investing, compared to other tangible features of the banking environment. Probing further into various groups of households, we find that sociability can induce stockholding among the less well off in Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland where stock market participation is widespread. On the other hand, the effect of generalized trust is strong in countries with limited participation and low average trust like Austria, Spain, and Italy, offering an explanation for the remarkably low participation rates of the wealthy living therein.

TI  - Estimating Ambiguity Preferences and Perceptions in Multiple Prior Models: Evidence from the Field
PY  - 2015
AB  - We develop a tractable method to estimate multiple prior models of decision-making under ambiguity. In a representative sample of the U.S. population, we measure ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains. We find that ambiguity aversion is common for uncertain events of moderate to high likelihood involving gains, but ambiguity seeking prevails for low likelihoods and for losses. We show that choices made under ambiguity in the gain domain are best explained by the α-MaxMin model, with one parameter measuring ambiguity aversion (ambiguity preferences) and a second parameter quantifying the perceived degree of ambiguity (perceptions about ambiguity). The ambiguity aversion parameter α is constant and prior probability sets are asymmetric for low and high likelihood events. The data reject several other models, such as MaxMin and MaxMax, as well as symmetric probability intervals. Ambiguity aversion and the perceived degree of ambiguity are both higher for men and for the college-educated. Ambiguity aversion (but not perceived ambiguity) is also positively related to risk aversion. In the loss domain, we find evidence of reflection, implying that ambiguity aversion for gains tends to reverse into ambiguity seeking for losses. Our model’s estimates for preferences and perceptions about ambiguity can be used to analyze the economic and financial implications of such preferences.

TI  - Do Investors Value Sustainability? A Natural Experiment Examining Ranking and Fund Flows
PY  - 2019
AB  - Examining a shock to the salience of the sustainability of the U.S. mutual fund market, we present causal evidence that investors marketwide value sustainability: being categorized as low sustainability resulted in net outflows of more than $12 billion while being categorized as high sustainability led to net inflows of more than $24 billion. Experimental evidence suggests that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance, but we do not find evidence that high‐sustainability funds outperform low‐sustainability funds. The evidence is consistent with positive affect influencing expectations of sustainable fund performance and nonpecuniary motives influencing investment decisions.

TI  - Ambiguity Attitudes in a Large Representative Sample
PY  - 2016
AB  - Using a theorem showing that matching probabilities of ambiguous events can capture ambiguity attitudes, we introduce a tractable method for measuring ambiguity attitudes and apply it in a large representative sample. In addition to ambiguity aversion, we confirm an ambiguity component recently found in laboratory studies: a-insensitivity, the tendency to treat subjective likelihoods as 50-50, thus overweighting extreme events. Our ambiguity measurements are associated with real economic decisions; specifically, a-insensitivity is negatively related to stock market participation. Ambiguity aversion is also negatively related to stock market participation, but only for subjects who perceive stock returns as highly ambiguous.

TI  - Do Investors Care about Impact?

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>We assess how investors’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable investments responds to the social impact of those investments, using a framed field experiment. While investors have a substantial WTP for sustainable investments, they do not pay significantly more for more impact. This also holds for dedicated impact investors. When investors compare several sustainable investments, their WTP responds to relative, but not to absolute, levels of impact. Regardless of investments’ impact, investors experience positive emotions when choosing sustainable investments. Our findings suggest that the WTP for sustainable investments is primarily driven by an emotional, rather than a calculative, valuation of impact.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>This paper investigates the divergence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings based on data from six prominent ESG rating agencies: Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD), Sustainalytics, Moody’s ESG (Vigeo-Eiris), S&amp;P Global (RobecoSAM), Refinitiv (Asset4), and MSCI. We document the rating divergence and map the different methodologies onto a common taxonomy of categories. Using this taxonomy, we decompose the divergence into contributions of scope, measurement, and weight. Measurement contributes 56% of the divergence, scope 38%, and weight 6%. Further analyzing the reasons for measurement divergence, we detect a rater effect where a rater’s overall view of a firm influences the measurement of specific categories. The results call for greater attention to how the data underlying ESG ratings are generated.</jats:p>

Pro-environment households are not more likely to hold pro-environment portfolios. This results from financial disengagement: they are less likely to own stocks, check pension balances, or make green active retirement planning choices. Green financial engagement is stronger in settings where financial literacy is higher or where informational hurdles are lower. Informational barriers appear to prevent financial market prices and returns from fully reflecting household environmental preferences.</jats:p>

TI  - The price of sin: The effects of social norms on markets
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract We provide evidence for the effects of social norms on markets by studying “sin” stocks—publicly traded companies involved in producing alcohol, tobacco, and gaming. We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a financial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns.

TI  - Share-ownership and the triple bottom line: A preliminary study
PY  - 2001
AB  - In this paper we present a preliminary analysis of one striking feature of the Australian political economy: the rise in private share-ownership. We note, first, that both political campaigners and corporate analysts have responded to this change in terms of the ‘triple bottom line’ of financial, environmental and social returns, then that this implies a unified rationality, and finally that this can be tested through environmentalism and the postmaterialism in Inglehart’s theory of value change. On that basis we analyse questions on share-ownership in the 1994 National Social Science Survey. Finding a significant divergence between the results for environmentalism and postmaterialism, we conclude that it would be over-optimistic to look to the ‘triple bottom line’ for a resolution of intensifying disputes over corporate activity. We start with a puzzle. On one hand, events at Genoa and at earlier meetings on world trade confirm that disquiet over global corporate activity is becoming both more intense and more widespread. On the other, more and more individuals are participating in that activity by acquiring shares in the corporations involved. Further, while private shareownership has risen throughout the postindustrial world since the 1980s, the trend is particularly marked in Australia. After the wave of full and partial privatisations, especially of the Commonwealth Bank and of Telstra, and of demutualisations such as those of the AMP and the NRMA, a slight majority of Australian adults are now share-owners, and Australia has the world’s highest levels of private investment in the stockmarket. In this paper we report a preliminary study of this rapid and extensive change in the political economy. After showing the rise in share-ownership and after comparing Australia with other countries through figures reported by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), we briefly introduce one political-academic response to this shift in corporate ownership: accounts of the ‘triple bottom line’ of financial, environmental and social returns. To test it, we develop a four-phase predictive model from responses to questions on share-ownership in the 1994 National Social Science Survey (Kelley et al. 1996). We first model demographic variables and then compare the results with the actual demographic patterns that the ASX has reported. It seems that ownership is becoming more diffuse than our model predicts. Secondly, we model the two attitudinal variables of environmentalism and of the postmaterialism in Inglehart’s theory of value change. Our assumption here is that all share-owners look for a financial return, whether in capital gains or in dividends, and that if

AB  - This study applies Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to classify manufacturing firms in Japan and the United States into two groups. One group, labelled DEAefficient', includes firms that were able to utilize their resources (e.g. assets, R&D, employees) efficiently. The other group, labelled 'DEA-inefficient', includes firms that did not utilize their resources as efficiently. Then using non-parametric statistical analysis, the study seeks to find out whether the different treatment of R&D expenditures is attributable to the country of origin of the firms (or the nationality of the managers), or attributable to the ability of the firms to utilize their resources efficiently.

TI  - Principles for sustainability rating of investment funds
PY  - 2005
AB  - During the last decade, the idea of sustainable investments hit the market. Investors both private and institutional started to supplement financial considerations with social and ecological ones. Meanwhile the supply of mutual funds in the ‘green’ investment sector increased enormously. Currently in Europe about 300 mutual funds are available that are managed according to sustainability and social responsibility. Potential investors face the difficulty of keeping track of the various funds and choosing among them based on a reliable comparative assessment. This paper outlines the basic principles and methods on which such a comparative sustainability rating is based. The method was designed to be analogous to rating of the funds financially. The sustainability rating is based on assessment of the research processes in the fund management as well as investigation of the fund portfolio in terms of composition and sustainability performance. It should support investors in their investment choices by offering them a third party view. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI  - Trends in the literature on socially responsible investment: looking for the keys under the lamppost
PY  - 2012
AB  - In this paper, we use online search engines and archive collections to examine the popularity of socially responsible investing (SRI) in newspapers and academic journals. A simple content analysis suggests that most of the papers on SRI focus on financial performance. This profusion of research is somewhat puzzling as most of the studies used roughly the same methodology and obtained very similar results. So, why are there so many studies on SRI financial performance? We argue that the academic literature on SRI is mostly data driven: the famous ‘looking for the keys under the lamppost’ syndrome. The question of the financial performance of the SRI funds is certainly relevant but maybe too much attention has been paid to this issue, whereas more research is needed on a conceptual and theoretical ground, in particular the aspirations of SRI investors, the relationship between regulation and SRI as well as the assessment of extra-financial performances.

TI  - Socially responsible investing: sustainability indices, ESG rating and information provider agencies
PY  - 2010
AB  - Currently, there are many sustainability indices and environmental, social and governance rating and information provider agencies (ESG IPAs). These organisations study companies in terms of sustainability, that is, economic, social, environmental and corporate governance criteria. But which are the criteria used to evaluate? This paper exhibits an exhaustive overview about the different criteria for evaluation used by sustainability indices and ESG agencies. The sample comprises a group of six sustainability indices and ten ESG agencies. The importance of the sustainability indices and ESG agencies is increasing in terms of encouraging the implementation of responsible corporate policies. This is considered as an important research topic because of the growth of social responsible financial markets, and the fact that investors are demanding more and more information about these topics. The results suggest that the methods currently being used by ESG agencies and sustainability indices are diverse and show a lack of standardisation.

TI  - Profiling Levels of Socially Responsible Consumer Behavior: A Cluster Analytic Approach and Its Implications for Marketing
PY  - 1995
AB  - Too often research in the area of marketing has equated socially responsible consumer behavior (SRCB) with ecologically conscious consumer behavior (ECCB) and developed a profile and subsequent marketing strategies based solely on the numbers of ECCBs performed. Socially conscious consumer behavior (SCCB) can impact particular groups within society (e.g. women, minorities, migrant workers, labor unions, etc.) or promote causes (e.g. gay rights, religious affiliation, avoidance of “sin” stocks, reduction of weapons production, etc.). Using an expanded understanding of what comprises socially responsible consumer behavior (SRCB), a cluster analysis of a national sample of adult U.S. consumers was performed. Four distinct market segments emerged. The clusters were formed based upon the respondents’ levels of ecologically and socially conscious consumer behavior. Each segment possessed unique attitudinal and demographic characteristics. The size and profile of each segment has important implications for marke...

TI  - What Counts in Social Managed Investments: Evidence from an International Survey
PY  - NA
AB  - Despite speculation from legislators and practitioners, no studies have investigated the reasons for social funds’ marginal market penetration. More generally, calls for a greater understanding of investors’ motivations, needs and purchasing intentions have not been met. By identifying what attracts consumers to social mutual funds and the information-processing difficulties consumers face when considering a purchase, this paper claims to make a meaningful contribution to the literature on social investment and mutual funds. In 2004 an Internet questionnaire survey attracted 382 interested, current and former social investors from Australasia, North America and Europe. The questionnaire measured motivations to invest in social funds and attitudes towards information sources and selection criteria. A restricted data set was used to test a set of propositions relating to respondents’ investment intentions and information asymmetries. Results were largely as expected. Respondents were attracted to social funds from moral conviction and from desires to influence corporate behavior. One in two respondents had chosen not to invest on the basis of informational concerns. Unexpectedly, social investment styles, portfolio listings and perceived accuracy of information were considered more important to an investment decision than management expenses. Findings underline a need for careful product design and management.

TI  - Ethical investment and the incentives for corporate environmental protection and social responsibility
PY  - 2003
AB  - This paper addresses some interrelated questions regarding ethical investments: does ethical screening provide any incentives for improved social responsibility within firms? Are ethical screened portfolios competitive compared with conventional funds with respect to risk-adjusted return? Does the risk-adjusted return of a screened portfolio depend on the screening strategy applied?



Considering ethical screening as a kind of segmentation of the equity market, it is shown that screening might create incentives for changes in firms' behaviour. The strength of this incentive depends on the relative share of screened portfolios, which in turn partially depends on the financial performance of the screened portfolios. While some theoretical arguments suggest that screening imposes a handicap compared with conventional portfolios, the empirical evidence does not suggest that screened portfolios systematically under-perform conventional portfolios.

TI  - Why Do We Invest Ethically
PY  - 2005
AB  - Analysis of three potential motives for ethical investment—financial returns, non-wealth returns, and social change—indicates that these motives are neither exhaustive nor exclusive; one single motive will not explain the behavior of all ethical investors. There may be a trade-off between financial and psychic returns for some investors. The trade-off for consumption-investors is expected to be close to zero (total utility is maximized at low levels of ethical investment in the fun of participation model) and is expected to vary with the ethical intensity of investment-investors, as shown when ethical intensity is included in the investor9s utility function. Psychic return can also be viewed as an increase in happiness, an approach that lends itself to empirical testing to improve our understanding of why we invest ethically.

TI  - Morals, money, ethical investing and economic psychology
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper reports on a questionnaire survey of 1146 ethical investors in the UK. Ethical investing usually means that certain companies are excluded from one's portfolio on non-economic grounds, e.g. because they manufacture armaments, test chemicals on live animals, or have poor pollution records. Is this an example where moral commitment rather than economics is driving economic decision making? Ethical investors were found to be neither cranks nor saints holding both ethical and not so ethical investments at the same time. A case is made that people are prepared to put their money where their morals are although there is no straightforward trade-off between principles and money. A broader analysis than that based on rational economic man is recommended: an economic psychology.

TI  - Eating difficulties, need for assisted eating, nutritional status and pressure ulcers in patients admitted for stroke rehabilitation
PY  - 2001
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the types and extent of eating difficulties, the need for assistance when eating, the nutritional status and pressure ulcers in consecutive patients (n = 162) admitted for stroke rehabilitation over a period of 1 year. Structured observations and assessments of eating, nutritional status (subjective global assessment of nutritional status), pressure ulcers and activities in daily living (Katz ADL-index) were performed by a nurse who also trained the staff to perform these assessments. Difficulties in eating were found in 80%, and 52.5% were unable to eat without assistance. Eating difficulties were: 'eats three-quarters or less of served food' (60%), difficulties in 'manipulating food on the plate' (56%), 'transportation of food to the mouth' (46%), 'sitting position' (29%), 'aberrant eating speed' (slow or forced) (26%), 'manipulating food in the mouth' (leakage, hoarding, chewing difficulties) (24%), 'swallowing difficulties' (18%), 'opening and/or closing the mouth' (16%), and 'alertness' (9%). Thirty-two percent were undernourished (49% of patients needing assisted eating and 13% of those not needing assistance, P < 0.0005). Among patients who were dependent in one or more functions according to the Katz ADL-index, 15% had pressure ulcers. The strongest eating variables for predicting nutritional status were 'alertness', 'swallowing difficulties', 'eats three-quarters or less of served food', and 'aberrant eating speed'. Nutritional status could in turn significantly predict pressure ulcers. Eating difficulties among patients with stroke are complex and the patient's situation before stroke adds to this complexity, especially among those dependent on assisted eating. As difficulties occur both among patients needing and not needing assisted eating, all patients with stroke admitted for rehabilitation need to be systematically assessed for eating difficulties and action needs to be taken to facilitate eating, especially as patients with eating difficulties risk becoming undernourished and in turn developing pressure ulcers.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of U.S. Socially Responsible Mutual Funds: Revisiting Doing Good and Doing Well
PY  - 2010
AB  - Do socially responsible funds, as a whole, perform as well as the average of all mutual funds in their respective categories? This paper examines fund characteristics as well as risk and performance measures of all available socially responsible funds (SRFs) in the U.S. mutual fund industry over the last fifteen years. The contribution of this paper is two unique findings. First, although SRFs have had a relative advantage in terms of lower expense ratios, lower annual turnover rates, lower tax cost ratios, and lower risk, SRFs also exhibit lower returns, and two risk‐adjusted return measures indicate SRFs have inferior reward‐to‐risk performance. In particular, domestic stock SRFs have not generated competitive returns relative to conventional funds in the same categories over the past ten to fifteen years. These results contrast those found in the extant SRI literature which suggest socially responsible investing has little or no cost. Second, a finer partitioning by fund type reveals not all SRFs have similar relative performance. SRFs in balanced fund and fixed‐income fund categories, especially during the past three years, have performed better than the category averages with lower risk, higher returns, and higher risk‐adjusted returns. This suggests the costs of socially responsible investing are not homogenous.

TI  - Corporate Reputation and Social Performance: The Importance of Fit
PY  - 2006
AB  - abstract  Utilizing data on a sample of large firms, we estimate a model of corporate reputation. We find reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, to be determined by a firm's social performance, financial performance, market risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the nature of its business activities. Furthermore, the reputational effect of social performance is found to vary both across sectors, and within sectors across the various types of social performance. Specifically, our results demonstrate the need to achieve a ‘fit’ among the types of corporate social performance undertaken and the firm's stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on whether the firm's activities ‘fit’ with environmental concerns in the eyes of stakeholders.

TI  - Facilitating sustainable development decisions: measuring stakeholder reactions
PY  - 2011
AB  - Sustainable development is an issue of increasing importance, in which organizations must engage multiple stakeholders and consider their objectives when deciding on organizational actions, but research provides little guidance regarding how managers can measure stakeholder reactions and use information to facilitate decision-making. The broad objective of this study is to provide insights useful for decision-making. In this study, we investigate in its natural and complex environment a real-world sustainable development conflict – whether to expand energy development in Wyoming. The primary issue is the impact that expanding energy development will have on wildlife and the environment. We collect data from both the local community and a broader national population for use in a quantitative analysis. We use contingent valuation methods to capture the social impact ascribed by the stakeholders. We conclude with a discussion of how this information can be used ex ante to inform decision-making for sustainable development. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI  - The social responsibility performance of ethical and solidarity funds: an approach to the case of Spain
PY  - 2004
AB  - In the past few years, concepts like ‘social responsibility investment’, ‘social and environmental investment’, ‘ethical investment’, ‘socially responsible funds’, ‘ethical funds’ and others have become increasingly important. All of them refer to similar but not equivalent concepts and demonstrate the existence of a new financial situation whose policy for action is based on economic, social and environmental criteria. The origin of what is today socially responsible investment (SRI) comes from the political environment experienced in the US and in Europe in the 1960s, when social and environmental movements, above all in support of peace, served to deepen the awareness of society of social responsibility and sustainable development issues. As a consequence of this, at the end of the 1970s the concept of social investment attracted a large number of American investors, who began to question the idea of financing the Vietnam War through investments. So, in 1971, there emerged the first true US ethical fund. In Europe, the first ethical fund was launched in Sweden in 1965 and in the UK the first ethical fund was launched in 1984. According to SiRi Group (2003), the leading countries in SRI in Europe are the UK, Sweden, France and Belgium. These events have involved noticeable changes in the size and composition of stock markets and even in the habits and financial culture of individual investors. However, these habits are not homogeneous in all international asset markets, and if we carry out an analysis of the ethical criteria by countries, some differences can be seen. In Spain, funds that can be identified as ethical investment funds have been marketed since 1997. The development of such investment funds has been less than in other developed countries, not only in number of funds or assets under management but also in the fund policy aspects and the establishment of social criteria. Another aspect that shows the weakness of SRI in Spain is the lack of engagement with companies made by these funds. As we show in this research, when we analyse Spanish SRI more deeply, we find that Spain is at an earlier stage of development than other European countries. The Spanish regulatory legislation focuses only on corporate governance issues (Olivencia and Aldama Reports); the selection methodology focuses mainly on the application of negative criteria (negative screening), and the Respectively, University Lecturer, University Professor and Assistant Lecturer, Department of Finance and Accounting, Universitat Jaume I, Castellon, Spain.

TI  - Assessing the effort of rating agencies in emerging economies: Some empirical evidence
PY  - 2005
AB  - Credit rating agencies (RAs) help reduce information asymmetries between corporate issuers and investors. However, although information asymmetries are more severe in emerging than in developed countries, corporate ratings bestow lower information content in the former. This is a problem since deserving corporations that are based in emerging countries require that the suitable rating they receive by a major RA—indispensable for them to issue debt in developed capital markets—be a credible signal to investors. Among the possible explanations, it is conjectured that this unsatisfactory situation might result from RAs not investing enough in collecting information on emerging countries’ corporations. Here, an indicator is used of RAs’ effort to gather information and test econometrically whether—controlling for both sovereign ratings and the corporate performance indicators used by RAs—higher effort affects corporate ratings. A negative relationship between RAs’ effort and corporate ratings is found in deve...

TI  - Some Determinants of the Socially Responsible Investment Decision: A Cross-Country Study
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper develops a general model of investor choice to analyze socially responsible investment (SRI). Drawing on data from a large survey of investors across five countries, we show that SRI may be driven more by investor attitudes toward the social aims of firms rather than by financial returns. We also show that investors who are concerned about social issues as consumers appear to extend this behavior into their portfolio strategies. We find little evidence that demographic factors affect SRI, but some indirect evidence that market context in terms of institutional ownership and the regulatory environment may play a role.

TI  - Measuring Investors’ Socially Responsible Preferences in Mutual Funds
PY  - 2011
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze investor behavior towards socially responsible mutual funds. The analysis is based on an experimental study where a sample of individuals takes investment decisions under different parameters of information about the investment alternatives and expected returns. In the experiment, each participant decides how to distribute an investment budget between two funds, returns on which are uncertain and change over time. Two treatments are conducted, each providing a different degree of information on the socially responsible (SR) character of one of the two investment alternatives. The results obtained suggest that although individuals’ criteria for investment are essentially guided by returns and diversification, participants invest significantly more in a fund when they are explicitly informed about its SR nature. In particular, participants who declare being concerned about SR actually invest significantly more in the SR alternative. Furthermore, the level of SR faithfulness among a small group of investors is such that they invest the main share of their budget in the SR fund, even when the return differential is highly unfavorable. Providing clear information about the SR characteristics of an investment is crucial to help investors express their preferences.

TI  - Investing in Socially Responsible Mutual Funds
PY  - 2003
AB  - We construct optimal portfolios of mutual funds whose objectives include socially responsible investment (SRI). Comparing portfolios of these funds to those constructed from the broader fund universe reveals the cost of imposing the SRI constraint on investors seeking the highest Sharpe ratio. This SRI cost depends crucially on the investor's views about asset pricing models and stock-picking skill by fund managers. To an investor who believes strongly in the CAPM and rules out managerial skill, i.e. a market-index investor, the cost of the SRI constraint is typically just a few basis points per month, measured in certainly-equivalent loss. To an investor who still disallows skill but instead believes to some degree in pricing models that associate higher returns with exposures to size, value, and momentum factors, the SRI constraint is much costlier, typically by at least 30 basis points per month. The SRI constraint imposes large costs on investors whose beliefs allow a substantial amount of fund-manager skill, i.e., investors who rely heavily on individual funds' track records to predict future performance.

TI  - A framework for comparing socially responsible investment markets: an analysis of the Dutch and Belgian retail markets.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The increasing popularity of socially responsible investment among individual investors throughout Europe reveals the need for a framework that allows the comparison of socially responsible retail markets in different European countries. This article proposes such a framework, containing 16 different characteristics of socially responsible retail markets describing the size, institutionalization and nature of this market and correcting for differences in the size of countries and financial markets. When this framework was applied to the Dutch and Belgian socially responsible retail markets, differences were found with respect to the nature of both markets (specifically the use of non-financial criteria, the asset allocation, the number of solidarity funds and investors' preferences for socially responsible savings products). Similarities were found with respect to the (absolute and relative) size and the degree of institutionalization of the socially responsible retail markets.

TI  - Relative performance of SRI equity funds: An analysis of European funds using Data Envelopment Analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - The main aims of this contribution are first to analyse the ethical level of European socially responsible investment (SRI) funds, secondly to measure the overall performance of the European SRI mutual funds with an appropriate data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and, finally, to investigate the relationship between the ethical level of mutual funds and their financial performance. In order to do so, we build an ethical measure, based on the main socially responsible features usually taken into account by SRI mutual funds, which evaluate their ethical strategies. In the time period of economic recession considered in the analysis, the triennium June 2006-June 2009, the mean returns of most mutual funds are negative, preventing the usual DEA models from being applied. In order to overcome this difficulty, we apply a special modification of these DEA models which can be used regardless of the phase of business cycle.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a reliable and valid integrative scale for online relationship quality based on both the relationship marketing and electronic commerce literature. Design/methodology/approach – The scale was developed using the approach put forward by Churchill (1979). The scale development and validation process includes a qualitative exploratory phase, three pre-tests and a final study using an online questionnaire (476 members of a consumer panel). Findings – The findings support a third-order integrative model of online relationship quality composed of three dimensions (trust, commitment and satisfaction). The final scale is composed of 21 items. Research limitations/implications – The study shows a lack of discrimination between satisfaction and trust, which other studies have also found. As the scale is validated in only one sector, online banking, it should be tested and replicated in other contexts (e.g. insurance). Practical implications – An instrument for asses...

PY  - 2000
AB  - Conversations about socially responsible investing are difficult because they combine facts with beliefs. Proponents of socially responsible investing believe that combining social goals with investments does good; opponents believe that such combinations are unwise or even illegitimate. In this article, I try to separate facts from beliefs. I report that the Domini Social Index, an index of socially responsible stocks, did better than the S&P 500 Index and that socially responsible mutual funds did better than conventional mutual funds over the 1990–98 period but the differences between their risk-adjusted returns are not statistically significant. Both groups of mutual funds trailed the S&P 500 Index. Errata

PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract This paper analyses the reasons why Spanish banks securitised in the period 2000–2007 on such a large scale that Spain has become the European country with the second-largest issuance volume after the UK. The results obtained by applying a logistic regression model to a sample of 408 observations indicate that liquidity and the search for improved performance are the decisive factors in securitisation. We find no evidence to support hypotheses regarding credit risk transfer and regulatory capital arbitrage. Our study also presents a more detailed analysis that differentiates between asset and liability securitisation programmes.

AB  - The internet is a powerful communication device. It is no surprise then that companies are moving towards using the internet as a communication device for the distribution of financial information. Thus, making the internet a new voluntary disclosure medium. This paper explores this new opportunity for the internet; as a voluntary disclosure medium. This is done by extending previous studies, which have examined the effect Public Accounting (PA) firm quality has on the adoption of Internet Financial Disclosure (IFD) and testing this in the Australian context. The empirical results show that, while accounting firm size plays a significant role in explaining the IFD quality, the PA firm quality is not important for the IFD adoption which in turn has far reaching implications for using the internet as a tool for financial disclosures.

TI  - The Ethical Mutual Fund Performance Debate: New Evidence from Canada
PY  - 2006
AB  - Although the academic interest in ethical mutual fund performance has developed steadily, the evidence to date is mainly sample-specific. To tackle this critique, new research should extend to unexplored countries. Using this as a motivation, we examine the performance and risk sensitivities of Canadian ethical mutual funds vis-a `-vis their conventional peers. In order to overcome the methodological deficiencies most prior papers suffered from, we use performance measurement approaches in the spirit of Carhart (1997, Journal of Finance 52(1): 57-82) and Ferson and Schadt (1996, Journal of Finance 51(2): 425-461). In doing so, we investigate the aggregated performance and investment style of ethical and conventional mutual funds and allow for time variation in the funds' systematic risk. Our Canadian evidence supports the conjecture that any performance differential between ethical mutual funds and their conventional peers is statistically insignificant.

PY  - 2008
AB  - There is an intimate connection between socially responsible investment (SRI) and corporate social responsibility (CSR): faced with the demands of their investors, listed companies have started to adopt CSR strategies to comply with the demands of ethical fund managers and ethical index managers. This paper is an exploratory study of the obstacles to SRI among individual investors in Spain. Individuals and financial consultants were surveyed about their current investment strategies, their preferences as regards criteria and ethical strategies, and the perceived obstacles for the development of SRI. The findings unveil the factors leading to the limited development of the SRI Spanish retail market. The paper offers guidelines that can be used by Spanish financial consultants and foreign fund managers when approaching the Spanish market.

The objective of this paper is to identify the factors which may influence fund management companies in making a decision to manage and/or market SRI funds and the variables that can determine whether or not this company has an explicit Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy. The results confirm our initial hypothesis that there is a positive relation between fund management companies' internal policy on CSR and the fact that they manage and/or market SRI mutual funds.

AB  - This paper addresses two key questions: (1) what factors influence firms' ability to build alliance capability and enjoy greater alliance success, where firm-level alliance success is measured in two ways: (a) abnormal stock market gains following alliance announcements and (b) managerial assessments of long term alliance performance; and (2) are the two alternate ways of assessing alliance success correlated? We find that firms with greater alliance experience and, more importantly, those that create a dedicated alliance function (with the intent of strategically coordinating alliance activity and capturing/disseminating alliance-related knowledge) realize greater success with alliances. More specifically, firms with a dedicated alliance function achieve greater abnormal stock market gains (average of 1.35%) and report that 63 percent of alliances are successful whereas firms without an alliance function achieve much lower stock market gains (average of 0.18%) and only a 50 percent long-term success rate. We also find a positive correlation between stock market-based measures of alliance success and alliance success measured through managerial assessments. In addition to providing insights into the development of alliance capability among firms, this paper is one of the first to provide empirical support for the efficient markets argument by demonstrating that the initial stock market response to a key event positively correlates to the long-term performance and value of the event.

TI  - What Determines the Shape of the Probability Weighting Function Under Uncertainty
PY  - 2001
AB  - Decision weights are an important component in recent theories of decision making under uncertainty. To better explain these decision weights, a two-stage approach has been proposed: First, the probability of an event is judged and then this probability is transformed by the probability weighting function known from decision making under risk. We extend the two-stage approach by allowing the probability weighting function to depend on the type of uncertainty. Using this more general approach, properties of decision weights can be attributed to properties of probability judgments and/or to properties of probability weighting. We present an empirical study that shows that it is indeed necessary to allow the probability weighting function to be source dependent. The analysis includes an examination of properties of the probability weighting function under uncertainty that have not been considered yet.

TI  - Understanding the Two Components of Risk Attitudes: An Experimental Analysis
PY  - 2011
AB  - Cumulative prospect theory introduced the weighting of probabilities as an additional component to capture risk attitudes. However, this addition would be a less significant challenge to expected utility theory (EU) if utility curvature and probability weighting showed strong positive correlation. In that case the utility curvature in EU alone, although not properly describing risky behavior in general, would still capture most of the variance of individual risk aversion. This study provides experimental evidence that such a strong and positive correlation does not exist. Although most individuals exhibit concave utility and convex probability weighting, the two components show no strong positive correlation.

TI  - SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITIES ON SUBJECTIVELY UNAMBIGUOUS EVENTS
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper suggests a behavioral definition of (subjective) ambiguity in an abstract setting where objects of choice are Savage-style acts. Then axioms are described that deliver probabilistic sophistication of preference on the set of unambiguous acts. In particular, both the domain and the values of the decision-maker's probability measure are derived from preference. It is argued that the noted result also provides a decision-theoretic foundation for the Knightian distinction between risk and ambiguity.

TI  - A Genuine Rank-Dependent Generalization of the Von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility Theorem
PY  - 2002
AB  - This paper uses “revealed probability trade-offs” to provide a natural foundation for probability weighting in the famous von Neumann and Morgenstern axiomatic set-up for expected utility. In particular, it shows that a rank-dependent preference functional is obtained in this set-up when the independence axiom is weakened to stochastic dominance and a probability trade-off consistency condition. In contrast with the existing axiomatizations of rank-dependent utility, the resulting axioms allow for complete flexibility regarding the outcome space. Consequently, a parameter-free test/elicitation of rank-dependent utility becomes possible. The probability-oriented approach of this paper also provides theoretical foundations for probabilistic attitudes towards risk. It is shown that the preference conditions that characterize the shape of the probability weighting function can be derived from simple probability trade-off conditions.

TI  - Modeling Ambiguity in Decisions Under Uncertainty
PY  - 1988
AB  - We present a model for predicting consumers' choices under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. We use the term ambiguity to distinguish the class of risky decisions for which the odds of an uncertain event are not precisely known. We show that our model predicts different decisions for individuals who are ambiguity averse, ambiguity seeking, or ambiguity indifferent, thus relaxing the constraint imposed on preferences by subjected expected utility theory.

TI  - SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY AND EXPECTED UTILITY WITHOUT ADDITIVITY
PY  - 1989
AB  - An act maps states of nature to outcomes; deterministic outcomes as well as random outcomes are included. Two acts f and g are comonotonic, by definition, if it never happens that f(s) >- f(t) and g(t) >- g(s) for some states of nature s and t. An axiom of comonotonic independence is introduced here. It weakens the von Neumann-Morgenstern axiom of independence as follows: If f >- g and if f, g, and h are comonotonic, then cff +(l-a)h>-ag+(1 -ac)h. If a nondegenerate, continuous, and monotonic (state independent) weak order over acts satisfies comonotonic independence, then it induces a unique non-(necessarily-)additive probability and a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility. Furthermore, one can compute the expected utility of an act with respect to the nonadditive probability, using the Choquet integral. This extension of the expected utility theory covers situations, as the Ellsberg paradox, which are inconsistent with additive expected utility. The concept of uncertainty aversion and interpretation of comonotonic independence in the context of social welfare functions are included.

TI  - Quantal Response Equilibrium and Overbidding in Private-Value Auctions
PY  - 2002
AB  - This paper reports the results of a private-values auction experiment in which expected costs of deviating from the Nash equilibrium bidding function are asymmetric, with the implication that upward deviations will be more likely in one treatment than in the other. Overbidding is observed in both treatments, but is more prevalent in the treatment where the costs of overbidding are lower. We specify and estimate a noisy (quantal response) model of equilibrium behavior. Estimated noise and risk aversion parameters are highly significant and consistent across treatments. The resulting two-parameter model tracks both the average bids and the distribution of bids remarkably well. Alternative explanations of overbidding are also considered. The estimates of parameters from a nonlinear probability weighting function yield a formulation that is essentially equivalent to risk aversion in this context. A model in which players experience a "joy of winning" provides a reasonable fit of the data but does significantly worse than the risk aversion model.

TI  - Random incentive systems in a dynamic choice experiment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Experiments frequently use a random incentive system (RIS), where only tasks that are randomly selected at the end of the experiment are for real. The most common type pays every subject one out of her multiple tasks (within-subjects randomization). Recently, another type has become popular, where a subset of subjects is randomly selected, and only these subjects receive one real payment (between-subjects randomization). In earlier tests with simple, static tasks, RISs performed well. The present study investigates RISs in a more complex, dynamic choice experiment. We find that between-subjects randomization reduces risk aversion. While within-subjects randomization delivers unbiased measurements of risk aversion, it does not eliminate carry-over effects from previous tasks. Both types generate an increase in subjects’ error rates. These results suggest that caution is warranted when applying RISs to more complex and dynamic tasks.

TI  - A Subjective Spin on Roulette Wheels
PY  - 2003
AB  - We provide a behavioral foundation to the notion of ‘mixture’ of acts, which is used to great advantage in the decision setting introduced by Anscombe and Aumann. 

Our construction allows one to formulate mixture-space axioms even in a fully subjective setting, without assuming the existence of randomizing devices. This simplifies the task of developing axiomatic models which only use behavioral data. Moreover, it is immune from the difficulty that agents may ‘distort’ the probabilities associated with randomizing devices. 

For illustration, we present simple subjective axiomatizations of some models of choice under uncertainty, including the maxmin expected utility model of Gilboa and Schmeidler, and Bewley’s model of choice with incomplete preferences.

AB  - An important reason why people violate expected utility theory is probability weighting. Previous studies on the probability weighting function typically assume a specific parametric form, exclude heterogeneity in individual preferences, and exclusively consider monetary decision making. This study presents a method to elicit the probability weighting function in rank-dependent expected utility theory that makes no prior assumptions about the functional form of the probability weighting function. We use both aggregate and individual subject data, thereby allowing for heterogeneity of individual preferences, and we examine probability weighting in a new domain, medical decision making. There is significant evidence of probability weighting both at the aggregate and at the individual subject level. The modal probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped, displaying both lower subadditivity and upper subadditivity. Probability weighting is in particular relevant at the boundaries of the unit interval. Compared to studies involving monetary outcomes, we generally find more elevation of the probability weighting function. The robustness of the empirical findings on probability weighting indicates its importance. Ignoring probability weighting in modeling decision under risk and in utility measurement is likely to lead to descriptively invalid theories and distorted elicitations.

TI  - Evaluation of the priority heuristic as a descriptive model of risky decision making: comment on Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig (2006).
PY  - 2008
AB  - E. Brandstatter, G. Gigerenzer, and R. Hertwig (2006) contended that their priority heuristic, a type of lexicographic semiorder model, is more accurate than cumulative prospect theory (CPT) or transfer of attention exchange (TAX) models in describing risky decisions. However, there are 4 problems with their argument. First, their heuristic is not descriptive of certain data that they did not review. Second, their analysis relied on a global index of fit, percentage of correct predictions of the modal choice. Such analyses can lead to wrong conclusions when parameters are not properly estimated from the data. When parameters are estimated from the data, CPT and TAX fit the D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (1979) data perfectly. Reanalysis shows that TAX and CPT do as well as the priority heuristic for 2 of the data sets reviewed and outperform the priority heuristic for the other 3. Third, when 2 of these sets of data are reexamined, the priority heuristic is seen to make systematic violations. Fourth, new critical implications have been devised for testing the family of lexicographic semiorders including the priority heuristic; new results with these critical tests show systematic evidence against lexicographic semiorder models.

TI  - Measuring the time stability of prospect theory preferences
PY  - 2010
AB  - Prospect Theory (PT) is widely regarded as the most promising descriptive model for decision making under uncertainty. Various tests have corroborated the validity of the characteristic fourfold pattern of risk attitudes implied by the combination of probability weighting and value transformation. But is it also safe to assume stable PT preferences at the individual level? This is not only an empirical but also a conceptual question. Measuring the stability of preferences in a multi-parameter decision model such as PT is far more complex than evaluating single-parameter models such as Expected Utility Theory under the assumption of constant relative risk aversion. There exist considerable interdependencies among parameters such that allegedly diverging parameter combinations could in fact produce very similar preference structures. In this paper, we provide a theoretic framework for measuring the (temporal) stability of PT parameters. To illustrate our methodology, we further apply our approach to 86 subjects for whom we elicit PT parameters twice, with a time lag of 1 month. While documenting remarkable stability of parameter estimates at the aggregate level, we find that a third of the subjects show significant instability across sessions.

TI  - DO WEALTH DIFFERENCES AFFECT FAIRNESS CONSIDERATIONS
PY  - 2006
AB  - The influence of relative wealth on fairness considerations is analyzed in an ultimatum game experiment in which participants receive large and widely unequal initial endowments. Subjects initially demonstrate a concern for fairness. With time however, behavior becomes at odds with both subgame perfection and fairness. Evidence of learning is detected for both proposers and receivers in the estimation of a structural reinforcement learning model. The estimation results suggest that, guided by foregone best responses and an acquired sense of deservingness, rich subjects become more selfish, whereas poor subjects, influenced only by their own experience, learn to tolerate this behavior.

AB  - Few attempts have yet been made to interrelate the major axiom systems of expected utility theory such as those presented by von Neumann—Morgenstern, Marschak, Savage, and Arrow. This paper attempts to consolidate the theoretical and empirical research on these axioms by showing the correspondences among the major axioms of each system and highlighting their similarities and differences in dealing with concepts such as probability and utility.

TI  - EXPECTED UTILITY WITH PURELY SUBJECTIVE NON-ADDITIVE PROBABILITIES
PY  - 1987
AB  - Acts are functions from the set of states of the world into the set of consequences. Savage proposed axioms regarding a binary relation on the set of acts which are necessary and sufficient for it to be representable by the functional ʃu(·)dP for some real-valued (utility) function u on the set of consequences and a (probability) measure P on the set of states of the world. The Ellsberg paradox leads us to reject one of Savage's main axioms - the Sure Thing Principle - and develop a more general theory, in which the probability measure need not be additive.

A cet effet, ils combinent des recherches de terrain comparatives experimentales avec des recherches ethnographique economiques dans deux groupes de petites exploitations agricoles, les Mapuche du Chili et les Sangu de Tanzanie. Ces experimentations, malgre des lacunes methodologiques, mettent en doute les approches theoriques standards. Concues afin de mesurer les preferences pour le risque directement, elles montrent que les Mapuche et les Sangu expriment une preference pour le risque dans leurs prises de decisions - suggerant que de facon generale les agriculteurs de subsistance n'agissent pas en fonction d'une aversion envers le risque. D'autre part, la preference pour le risque semble s'expliquer essentiellement en fonction du groupe culturel. En conclusion, les AA. esquissent brievement une alternative theorique au modele standard.

PY  - 2000
AB  - In this paper we investigate the attitudes toward risk of bettors in British horse races. The model we use allows us to go beyond the expected utility framework and to explore various alternative proposals by estimating a multinomial model on a 34,443‐race data set. We find that rank‐dependent utility models do not fit the data noticeably better than expected utility models. On the other hand, cumulative prospect theory has higher explanatory power. Our preferred estimates suggest a pattern of local risk aversion similar to that proposed by Friedman and Savage.

TI  - Parameter-Free Elicitation of Utility and Probability Weighting Functions
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper proposes a two-step method to successively elicit utility functions and decision weights under rank-dependent expected utility theory and its "more descriptive" version: cumulative prospect theory. The novelty of the method is that it is parameter-free, and thus elicits the whole individual preference functional without imposing any prior restriction. This method is used in an experimental study to elicit individual utility and probability weighting functions for monetary outcomes in the gain and loss domains. Concave utility functions are obtained for gains and convex utility functions for losses. The elicited weighting functions satisfy upper and lower subadditivity and are consistent with previous parametric estimations. The data also show that the probability weighting function for losses is more "elevated" than for gains.

TI  - Ambiguity and Uncertainty in Probabilistic Inference.
PY  - 1985
AB  - Abstract : Ambiguity results from having limited knowledge of the process that generates outcomes. It is argued that many real-world processes are perceived to be ambiguous; moreover, as Ellsberg demonstrated, this poses problems for theories of probability operationalized via choices amongst gambles. A descriptive model of how people make judgments under ambiguity in tasks where data come from a source of limited, but not exactly known reliability, is proposed. The model assumes an anchoring-and-adjustment process in which data provides the anchor, and adjustments are made for what might have been. The latter is modeled as the result of a mental simulation process that incorporates the unreliability of the source and one's attitude toward ambiguity in the circumstances. A two-parameter model of this process is shown to be consistent with: Keynes' idea of the weight of evidence, the non-additivity of complementary probabilities, current psychological theories of risk, and Ellsberg's original paradox. The model is tested in four experiments at both the individual and group levels. In experiments 1-3, the model is shown to predict judgments quite well; in experiment 4, the inference model is shown to predict choices between gambles. The results and model are then discussed with respect to the importance of ambiguity in assessing perceived uncertainty; the use of cognitive strategies in judgments under ambiguity; the role of ambiguity in risky choice; and extensions of the model.

TI  - Venture Theory: A Model of Decision Weights
PY  - 1990
AB  - Several theories suggest that people replace probabilities by decision weights when evaluating risky outcomes. This paper proposes a model, called venture theory, of how people assess decision weights. It is assumed that people first anchor on a stated probability and then adjust this by mentally simulating other possible values. The amount of mental simulation is affected by the absolute size of payoffs, the extent to which the anchor deviates from the extremes of 0 and 1, and the level of perceived ambiguity concerning the relevant probability. The net effect of the adjustment i.e., up or down vis-i-vis the anchor reflects the relative weight given in imagination to values above as opposed to below the anchor. This, in turn, is taken to be a function of both individual and situational variables, and in particular, the sign and size of payoffs. Cognitive and motivational factors therefore both play important roles in determining decision weights. Assuming that people evaluate outcomes by a prospect theory value function Kahneman and Tversky 1979 and are cautious in the face of risk, fourteen predictions are derived concerning attitudes toward risk and ambiguity as functions of different levels of payoffs and probabilities. The results of three experiments are reported. Whereas only a subset of the model's predictions can be tested in Experiment 1, all fourteen are tested in Experiments 2 and 3 using hypothetical and real payoffs, respectively. Several of the model's predictions are not supported in Experiment 2 but almost all are validated in Experiments 1 and 3. The failures relate to the exact nature of probability × payoff interactions in attitudes toward risk and ambiguity for losses. The theory and results are discussed in relation to other experimental evidence, future tests of the theory, alternative models of risky choice, and implications of venture theory for explaining further phenomena.

TI  - Eliciting von Neumann-Morgenstern Utilities When Probabilities Are Distorted or Unknown
PY  - 1996
AB  - This paper proposes a new method, the gamble-tradeoff method, for eliciting utilities in decision under risk or uncertainty. The elicitation of utilities, to be used in the expected utility criterion, turns out to be possible even if probabilities are ambiguous or unknown. A disadvantage of the tradeoff method is that a few more questions usually must be asked to clients. Also, the lotteries that are needed are somewhat more complex than in the certainty-equivalent method or in the probability-equivalent method. The major advantage of the tradeoff method is its robustness against probability distortions and misconceptions, which constitute a major cause of violations of expected utility and generate inconsistencies in utility elicitation. Thus the tradeoff method retains full validity under prospect theory, rank-dependent utility, and the combination of the two, i.e., cumulative prospect theory.

The tradeoff method is tested for monetary outcomes and for outcomes describing life-duration. We find higher risk aversion for life duration, but the tradeoff method elicits similar curvature of utility. Apparently the higher risk aversion for life duration is due to more pronounced deviations from expected utility.

TI  - MAxmin expected utility with non-unique prior
PY  - 1989
AB  - Acts are functions from states of nature into finite-support distributions over a set of 'deterministic outcomes'. We characterize preference relations over acts which have a numerical representation by the functional J(f) = min > {∫ uo f dP / P∈C } where f is an act, u is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility over outcomes, and C is a closed and convex set of finitely additive probability measures on the states of nature. In addition to the usual assumptions on the preference relation as transitivity, completeness, continuity and monotonicity, we assume uncertainty aversion and certainty-independence. The last condition is a new one and is a weakening of the classical independence axiom: It requires that an act f is preferred to an act g if and only if the mixture of f and any constant act h is preferred to the same mixture of g and h. If non-degeneracy of the preference relation is also assumed, the convex set of priors C is uniquely determined. Finally, a concept of independence in case of a non-unique prior is introduced.

TI  - Do generalized expected utility theories capture persisting properties of individual decision makers
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract Expected utility theory and two generalizations of it (rank-dependent utility theory and cumulative prospect theory), which have been proposed to describe individuals' risky choice behavior, have been examined. A characteristic feature of these models is subjective weighting of outcomes and probabilities. This study investigates whether individually determined weighting functions (utility functions and weighting functions for probabilities) capture individual traits of decision makers. To verify this, temporal constancy of individual subjective weighting functions and predictability of individuals' future decisions were considered. Sixty-four subjects had to choose between the same 150 gamble pairs in three separate sessions, with an interval of one week between sessions. Descriptive analyses showed considerable temporal inconsistency in the individuals' decision behavior. It was, therefore, not surprising that the analysis of temporal constancy of individual weighting functions yielded frequent rejections of the constancy assumption. An additional analysis was conducted, predicting decision behavior in later sessions using individual weighting functions estimated from earlier sessions. This analysis takes the inconsistency into account explicitly and suggests that the models' weighting functions, indeed, seemed to capture persisting properties of the decision makers. While the assumption of subjective weighting of outcomes (as in expected utility theory) proved very important for predicting future decisions, the additional assumption of subjective weighting of probabilities (as in rank-dependent utility theory or cumulative prospect theory) improved predictability only to a minor degree.

TI  - From subjective probabilities to decision weights: The effect of asymmetric loss functions on the evaluation of uncertain outcomes and events.
PY  - 1994
AB  - Much of decision aiding uses a divide-and-con quer strategy to help people with risky decisions. Assessing the utility of outcomes and one's degree of belief in their likelihood are assumed to be separable tasks, the results of which can then be combined to determine the preferred alternative. Evidence from different areas of psychology now provides a growing consensus that this assumption is too simplistic. Observed dependencies in the evaluation of uncertain outcomes and the likelihood of the events giving rise to them are frequent and systematic. Dependencies seem to derive from general strategic processes that take into consideration asymmetric costs of over- vs. underestimates of uncertain quantities. This asymmetric-loss-function interpretation provides a psychological explanation for observed judgments and decisions under uncertainty and links them to other judgment tasks. The decision weights estimated when applying dependent-utility models to choices are not simply reflections of perceived subjective probability but a response to several constraints, all of which modify the weight of risky or uncertain outcomes. Perhaps more than any other social science, psychology maintains an ongoing debate about its status as a coherent field of scholarship (cf. Fowler, 1990; Koch, 1969; Simon, 1992), often expressing genuine concern about the paucity of established and cumulative results and theories. Thus, note the emergence of a consensus on an important behavioral fact from different areas of psychology as well as economics. This article brings together some commonalities in results and in the mechanisms designed to explain them. These should be of theoretical as well as practical interest to anybody interested in human judgments and decisions. With this interpretative review, I attempt to present these often technical results and theories in an integrative and more accessible way. I argue that people's behavior in the judgment and decision situations discussed can be seen as responsive to self- or outwardly imposed constraints in their envi

TI  - Small feedback‐based decisions and their limited correspondence to description‐based decisions
PY  - 2003
AB  - The present paper explores situations in which the information available to decision makers is limited to feedback concerning the outcomes of their previous decisions. The results reveal that experience in these situations can lead to deviations from maximization in the opposite direction of the deviations observed when the decisions are made based on a description of the choice problem. Experience was found to lead to a reversed common ratio/certainty effect, more risk seeking in the gain than in the loss domain, and to an underweighting of small probabilities. Only one of the examined properties of description-based decisions, loss aversion, seems to emerge robustly in these ‘feedback-based’ decisions. These results are summarized with a simple model that illustrates that all the unique properties of feedback-based decisions can be a product of a tendency to rely on recent outcomes.

TI  - The Missing Link: Unifying Risk Taking and Time Discounting
PY  - 2012
AB  - Standard economic models view risk taking and time discounting as two independent dimensions of decision makers' behavior. However, mounting experimental evidence demonstrates the existence of robust and systematic interaction effects. There are striking parallels in patterns of risk taking and time discounting behavior, which suggests that there is a common underlying force driving these interactions. Here we show that decision makers' anticipation of something going wrong in the future conjointly with their proneness to probability weighting generates a unifying framework for explaining seven puzzling regularities: delay-dependent risk tolerance, aversion to sequential resolution of uncertainty, preferences for resolution timing, hyperbolic discounting, subadditive discounting, the differential discounting of risky and certain outcomes, and the order dependence of prospect valuation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our framework for understanding real-world behavior, such as the coexistence of underinsuring and overinsuring.

TI  - The Rich Domain of Uncertainty: Source Functions and Their Experimental Implementation
PY  - 2011
AB  - We often deal with uncertain events for which no probabilities are known. Several normative models have been proposed. Descriptive studies have usually been qualitative, or they estimated ambiguity aversion through one single number. This paper introduces the source method, a tractable method for quantitatively analyzing uncertainty empirically. The theoretical key is the distinction between different sources of uncertainty, within which subjective (choice-based) probabilities can still be defined. Source functions convert those subjective probabilities into willingness to bet. We apply our method in an experiment, where we do not commit to particular ambiguity attitudes but let the data speak.

TI  - A closer look at the Russian roulette problem: A re-examination of the nonlinearity of the prospect theory's decision weight π
PY  - 2009
AB  - Utilizing the Russian roulette problem as an exemplar, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) developed a weighting function @p to explain that the Allais Paradox arises because people behave so as to maximize overall value rather than expected utility (EU). Following the way that ''overweighting of small probabilities'' originated from the Russian roulette problem, this research measured individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) as well as their happiness for a reduction of the probability of death, and examined whether the observed figures were compatible with the nonlinearity of the weighting function. Data analysis revealed that the nonlinear properties estimated by straight measures differed from those derived from preferential choices [D. Kahneman, A. Tversky, Prospect theory: an analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica 47 (1979) 263-291] and formulated by [A. Tversky, D. Kahneman, Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5 (1992) 297-323]. The controversies and questions to the proposed properties of the decision weight were discussed. An attempt was made to draw the research attention from which function was being maximized to whether people behave as if they were trying to maximize some generalized expectation.

TI  - Risk Averse Behavior in Generalized Matching Pennies Games
PY  - 2003
AB  - In experimental studies of behavior in 2×2 games with unique mixed strategy equilibria, observed choice frequencies are systematically different from mixed-strategy Nash predictions. This paper examines experimental results for a variety of such games, and shows that a structural econometric model which incorporates risk aversion into a quantal response equilibrium explains the data very well. Moreover, risk aversion estimates are stable across the different games and are close to those obtained from laboratory and field auction data, as well as from individual lottery choice experiments.

TI  - A Belief-Based Account of Decision Under Uncertainty
PY  - 1998
AB  - We develop a belief-based account of decision under uncertainty. This model predicts decisions under uncertainty from (i) judgments of probability, which are assumed to satisfy support theory; and (ii) decisions under risk, which are assumed to satisfy prospect theory. In two experiments, subjects evaluated uncertain prospects and assessed the probability of the respective events. Study 1 involved the 1995 professional basketball playoffs; Study 2 involved the movement of economic indicators in a simulated economy. The results of both studies are consistent with the belief-based account, but violate the partition inequality implied by the classical theory of decision under uncertainty.

TI  - Error Propagation in the Elicitation of Utility and Probability Weighting Functions
PY  - 2006
AB  - Elicitation methods in decision-making under risk allow us to infer the utilities of outcomes as well as the probability weights from the observed preferences of an individual. An optimally efficient elicitation method is proposed, which takes the inevitable distortion of preferences by random errors into account and minimizes the effect of such errors on the inferred utility and probability weighting functions. Under mild assumptions, the optimally efficient method for eliciting utilities and probability weights is the following three-stage procedure. First, a probability is elicited whose subjective weight is one half. Second, the utility function is elicited through the midpoint chaining certainty equivalent method using the probability elicited at the first stage. Finally, the probability weighting function is elicited through the probability equivalent method.

TI  - Investigating Generalisations of Expected Utility Theory using Experimental Data
PY  - 1994
AB  - A number of generalizations of the expected utility preference functional are estimated using experimentally generated data involving 100 pairwise choice questions repeated on two separate occasions. Likelihood ratio tests are conducted to investigate the statistical superiority of the various generalizations and the Akaike information criterion is used to distinguish between them. The economic superiority of the various generalizations is also explored and the paper concludes that, for many subjects, the superiority of several of the generalizations is not established.

TI  - Risk Aversion and Expected-Utility Theory: A Calibration Theorem
PY  - 2000
AB  - Within the expected-utility framework, the only explanation for risk aversion is that the utility function for wealth is concave: A person has lower marginal utility for additional wealth when she is wealthy than when she is poor. This paper provides a theorem showing that expected-utility theory is an utterly implausible explanation for appreciable risk aversion over modest stakes: Within expected-utility theory, for any concave utility function, even very little risk aversion over modest stakes implies an absurd degree of risk aversion over large stakes. Illustrative calibrations are provided.

TI  - Nonlinear Decision Weights in Choice Under Uncertainty
PY  - 1999
AB  - In most real-world decisions, consequences are tied explicitly to the outcome of events. Previous studies of decision making under uncertainty have indicated that the psychological weight attached to an event, called a decision weight, usually differs from the probability of that event. We investigate two sources of nonlinearity of decision weights: subadditivity of probability judgments, and the overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of medium and large probabilities. These two sources of nonli nearity are combined into a two-stage model of choice under uncertainty. In the first stage, events are taken into subjective probability judgments, and the second stage takes probability judgments into decision weights. We then characterize the curvature of the decision weights by extending a condition employed by Wu and Gonzalez (1996) in the domain of risk to the domain of uncertainty and show that the nonlinearity of decision weights can be decomposed into subadditivity of probability judgments and the curvature of the probability weighting function. Empirical tests support the proposed two-stage model and indicate that decision weights are concave then convex. More specifically, our results lend support for a new property of subjective probability ju dgments, interior additivity (subadditive at the boundaries, but additive away from the boundaries), and show that the probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped as in Wu and Gonzalez (1996).

TI  - Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy
PY  - 2004
AB  - I plan to sketch the key developments of the past decade and a half of monetary policy in the United States from the perspective of someone who has been in the policy trenches. I will offer some conclusions about what I believe has been learned thus far, though I suspect, as is so often the case, the passing of time, further study, and reflection will deepen our understanding of these developments. This is a personal statement; I am not speaking for my current colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the many others with whom I have served over these many years. The tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in 1979, then led by my predecessor Paul Volcker, ultimately broke the back of price acceleration in the United States, ushering in a two-decade long decline in inflation that eventually brought us to the current state of price stability. The fall in inflation over this period has been global in scope, and arguably beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic inflationfighters. I have little doubt that an unrelenting focus of monetary policy on achieving price stability has been the principal contributor to disinflation. Indeed, the notion, advanced by Milton Friedman more than 30 years ago, that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon, is no longer a controversial proposition in the profession. But the size and geographic extent of the decline in inflation raises the question of whether other forces have been at work as well. I am increasingly of the view that, at a minimum, monetary policy in the last two decades has been operating in an environment particularly conducive to the pursuit of price stability. The principal features of this environment included (i) increased political support for stable prices, which was the consequence of, and reaction to, the unprecedented peacetime inflation in the 1970’s, (ii) globalization, which unleashed powerful new forces of competition, and (iii) an acceleration of productivity, which at least for a time held down cost pressures. I believe we at the Fed, to our credit, did gradually come to recognize the structural economic changes that we were living through and accordingly altered our understanding of the key parameters of the economic system and our policy stance. The central banks of other industrialized countries have grappled with many of the same issues. But as we lived through it, there was much uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and about the influence of monetary policy. Despite those uncertainties, the trauma of the 1970’s was still so vivid throughout the 1980’s that preventing a return to accelerating prices was the unvarying focus of our efforts during those years. In recognition of the lag in monetary policy’s impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an important feature of policy. As a consequence, this approach elevated forecasting to an even more prominent place in policy deliberations. After an almost uninterrupted stint of easing from the summer of 1984 through the spring of 1987, the Fed again began to lean against increasing inflationary pressures, which were in part the indirect result of rapidly rising stock prices. We had recognized the risk of an adverse reaction in a stock market that had recently experienced a steep run-up—indeed, we actively engaged in contingency planning against that possibility. * Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20551. 1 I, nonetheless, wish to thank my colleagues David Stockton, David Wilcox, Don Kohn, Ben Bernanke, and John Taylor, for their many suggestions and reminiscences.

TI  - The Descriptive and Predictive Adequacy of Theories of Decision Making Under Uncertainty/Ambiguity
PY  - 2010
AB  - In this paper we examine the performance of theories of decision making under uncertainty/ambiguity from the perspective of their descriptive and predictive power. To this end, we employ an innovative experimental design which enables us to reproduce ambiguity in the laboratory in a transparent and non-probabilistic way. We find that judging theories on the basis of their theoretical appeal, or on their ability to do well in terms of estimation, is not the same as judging them on the basis of their predictive power. We find that the models that perform better in an aggregate sense are Gilboa and Schmeidler’s MaxMin and MaxMax Expected Utility Models, and Ghiradarto et al.’s Alpha Model, implying that more elegant theoretical models do not perform as well as relatively simple models. This suggests that decision-makers, when confronted with a difficult problem, try to simplify it, rather than apply a sophisticated decision rule.

TI  - A Quantitative Measurement of Regret Theory
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper introduces a method to measure regret theory, a popular theory of decision under uncertainty. Regret theory allows for violations of transitivity, and it may seem paradoxical to quantitatively measure an intransitive theory. We adopt the trade-off method and show that it is robust to violations of transitivity. Our method makes no assumptions about the shape of the functions reflecting utility and regret. It can be performed at the individual level, taking account of preference heterogeneity. Our data support the main assumption of regret theory, that people are disproportionately averse to large regrets, even when event-splitting effects are controlled for. The findings are robust: similar results were obtained in two measurements using different stimuli. The data support the reliability of the trade-off method: its measurements could be replicated using different stimuli and were not susceptible to strategic responding.

TI  - Weighing Risk and Uncertainty
PY  - 1995
AB  - Decision theory distinguishes between risky prospects, where the probabilities associated with the possible outcomes are assumed to be known, and uncertain prospects, where these probabilities are not assumed to be known. Studies of choice between risky prospects have suggested a nonlinear transformation of the probability scale that overweights low probabilities and underweights moderate and high probabilities. The present article extends this notion from risk to uncertainty by invoking the principle of bounded subadditivity: An event has greater impact when it turns impossibility into possibility, or possibility into certainty, than when it merely makes a possibility more or less likely. A series of studies provides support for this principle in decision under both risk and uncertainty and shows that people are less sensitive to uncertainty than to risk. Finally, the article discusses the relationship between probability judgments and decision weights and distinguishes relative sensitivity from ambiguity aversion. Decisions are generally made without definite knowledge of their consequences. The decisions to invest in the stock market, to undergo a medical operation, or to go to court are generally made without knowing in advance whether the market will go up, the operation will be successful, or the court will decide in one's favor. Decision under uncertainty, therefore, calls for an evaluation of two attributes: the desirability of possible outcomes and their likelihood of occurrence. Indeed, much of the study of decision making is concerned with the assessment of these values and the manner in which they are—or should be— combined. In the classical theory of decision under risk, the utility of each outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. Consider a simple prospect of the form (x, p) that offers a probability p to win $jc and a probability 1 — p to win nothing. The expected utility of this prospect is given by pu(x) + (1 — p)w(O), where u is the utility function for money. Expected utility theory has been developed to explain attitudes toward risk, namely, risk aversion and risk seeking. Risk aversion is denned as a preference for a sure outcome over a prospect with an equal or greater expected value. Thus, choosing a sure $100 over an even chance to win $200 or nothing is an expression of risk aversion. Risk seeking is exhibited if a prospect is preferred to a sure outcome with equal or greater expected value. It is commonly assumed that people are risk averse, which is explained in expected utility theory by a concave utility function. The experimental study of decision under risk has shown that people often violate both the expected utility model and the

TI  - How Consistent Are Probability Tradeoffs in Individual Preferences under Risk
PY  - 1999
AB  - Experimental research has shown that preference functionals which describe individual choices under risk vary according to which particular type of lottery individuals have to consider. A « risk-structure » can thus be defined as a subset of prospects sufficiently ‘close’ from each other to trigger the same procedural search from the individual and thus to be described by the same preference functional. In a Marschak-Machina triangle, they are subsets of the triangle with a given indifference field in each of them. Four such risk-structures can be shown to emerge from experiments and be roughly stylized. These results seem to be fairly robust with respect to the protocol and the hypotheses used (Abdellaoui and Munier, 1994,1998). They provide experimental evidence and some potentially significant frame of reference to theories based on lottery dependent preferences (Becker and Sarin, 1987,1989) or, more generally, on local utility preferences (Machina, 1982). According to these results, it would be surprising that a given estimate of a known decision model could accommodate observations scattered throughout the whole Marschak-Machina triangle. With such a sample of data, necessarily mediocre results would thus emerge from econometric testing of any model. This is certainly not rejected by the results of such econometric testing (Hey and Orme, 1994, Harless and Camerer, 1994).

TI  - Choice-Based Elicitation and Decomposition of Decision Weights for Gains and Losses Under Uncertainty
PY  - 2005
AB  - This paper reports the results of an experimental parameter-free elicitation and decomposition of decision weights under uncertainty. Assuming cumulative prospect theory, utility functions were elicited for gains and losses at an individual level using the tradeoff method. Subsequently, decision weights were elicited through certainty equivalents of uncertain two-outcome prospects. Furthermore, decision weights were decomposed using observable choice instead of invoking other empirical primitives, as in previous experimental studies. The choice-based elicitation of decision weights allows for a quantitative study of their characteristics, and also allows, among other things, for the examination of the sign-dependence hypothesis for observed choice under uncertainty. Our results confirm concavity of the utility function in the gain domain and bounded subadditivity of decision weights and choice-based subjective probabilities. We also find evidence for sign dependence of decision weights.

TI  - Maxmin Expected Utility with a Non-Unique Prior
PY  - NA
AB  - Acts are functions from states of nature into finite-support distributions over a set of 'deterministic outcomes'. We characterize preference relations over acts which have a numerical representation by the functional J(f) = min > {∫ uo f dP / P∈C } where f is an act, u is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility over outcomes, and C is a closed and convex set of finitely additive probability measures on the states of nature. In addition to the usual assumptions on the preference relation as transitivity, completeness, continuity and monotonicity, we assume uncertainty aversion and certainty-independence. The last condition is a new one and is a weakening of the classical independence axiom: It requires that an act f is preferred to an act g if and only if the mixture of f and any constant act h is preferred to the same mixture of g and h. If non-degeneracy of the preference relation is also assumed, the convex set of priors C is uniquely determined. Finally, a concept of independence in case of a non-unique prior is introduced.

TI  - The predictive utility of generalized expected utility theories
PY  - 1994
AB  - Many alternative theories have been proposed to explain violations of expected utility
(EU) theory observed in experiments. Several recent studies test some of these alternative
theories against each other. Formal tests used to judge the theories usually count the
number of responses consistent with the theory, ignoring systematic variation in responses
that are inconsistent. We develop a maximum-likelihood estimation method which uses
all the information in the data, creates test statistics that can be aggregated across studies,
and enables one to judge the predictive utility-the fit and parsimony-of utility theories.
Analyses of 23 data sets, using several thousand choices, suggest a menu of theories which
sacrifice the least parsimony for the biggest improvement in fit. The menu is: mixed
fanning, prospect theory, EU, and expected value. Which theories are best is highly
sensitive to whether gambles in a pair have the same support (EU fits better) or not (EU
fits poorly). Our method may have application to other domains in which various theories
predict different subsets of choices (e.g., refinements of Nash equilibrium in noncooperative
games).

TI  - Eliciting decision weights by adapting de Finetti’s betting-odds method to prospect theory
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper extends de Finetti’s betting-odds method for assessing subjective beliefs to ambiguous events. Thus, a tractable manner for measuring decision weights under ambiguity is obtained. De Finetti’s method is so transparent that decision makers can evaluate the relevant tradeoffs in complex situations. The resulting data can easily be analyzed, using nonparametric techniques. Our extension is implemented in an experiment on predicting next-day’s performance of the Dow Jones and Nikkei stock indexes, where we test the existence and nature of rank dependence, finding usual patterns. We also find violations of rank dependence.

TI  - Models of Stochastic Choice and Decision Theories: Why Both are Important for Analyzing Decisions
PY  - 2007
AB  - We select a menu of seven popular decision theories and embed each theory in five models of stochastic choice including tremble, Fechner and random utility model. We find that the estimated parameters of decision theories differ significantly when theories are combined with different models. Depending on the selected model of stochastic choice we obtain different rankings of decision theories with regard to their goodness of fit to the data. The fit of all analyzed decision theories improves significantly when they are embedded in a Fechner model of heteroscedastic truncated errors or a random utility model.

PY  - 1986
AB  - Cost-benefit and risk analysis studies that model tradeoffs between the present and the distant future by means of present value discounting have been criticized for according the future, and thus future generations, far too little importance. This paper presents an alternative means of modeling tradeoffs between different periods that accords the future far more importance than present value discounting, and that is no more difficult to apply. The paper also presents a means of modeling the preference issue of concern for equity or stability between different periods.

TI  - Estimating risk attitudes in denmark: A field experiment
PY  - 2007
AB  - We estimate individual risk attitudes using controlled experiments in the field in Denmark. The experiments were carried out across Denmark using a representative sample of 253 people between 19 and 75 years of age. Risk attitudes are estimated for various individuals differentiated by socio-demographic characteristics. Our results indicate that the average Dane is risk averse, and that risk neutrality is an inappropriate assumption to apply. We also find that risk attitudes vary significantly with respect to several important socio-demographic variables such as age and education. However, we do not find any effect of sex on risk attitudes.

TI  - RISK PERCEPTION AND THE ANALYSIS OF RISK ATTITUDES
PY  - 1981
AB  - Risk has long been recognised as an important feature of the environment facing farmers. In recent years the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory has been used to analyse decision making under risk. However, many people behave in a manner inconsistent with the expected utility theory. One widely suggested explanation is based on subjective probability distortion. A number of attempts to incorporate this phenomenon into utility theories have been made. In this paper, the problems of analysing subjective probability distortion are discussed. Evidence from a survey of farmers' risk attitudes undertaken in conjunction with the 1977 BAE Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey is analysed in the light of this discussion.

TI  - Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms
PY  - 1961
AB  - Are there uncertainties that are not risks? There has always been a good deal of skepticism about the behavioral significance of Frank Knight's distinction between “measurable uncertainty” or “risk”, which may be represented by numerical probabilities, and “unmeasurable uncertainty” which cannot. Knight maintained that the latter “uncertainty” prevailed – and hence that numerical probabilities were inapplicable – in situations when the decision-maker was ignorant of the statistical frequencies of events relevant to his decision; or when a priori calculations were impossible; or when the relevant events were in some sense unique; or when an important, once-and-for-all decision was concerned. Yet the feeling has persisted that, even in these situations, people tend to behave “as though” they assigned numerical probabilities, or “degrees of belief,” to the events impinging on their actions. However, it is hard either to confirm or to deny such a proposition in the absence of precisely-defined procedures for measuring these alleged “degrees of belief.” What might it mean operationally, in terms of refutable predictions about observable phenomena, to say that someone behaves “as if” he assigned quantitative likelihoods to events: or to say that he does not? An intuitive answer may emerge if we consider an example proposed by Shackle, who takes an extreme form of the Knightian position that statistical information on frequencies within a large, repetitive class of events is strictly irrelevant to a decision whose outcome depends on a single trial.

TI  - Loss Aversion Under Prospect Theory: A Parameter-Free Measurement
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agrowing body of qualitative evidence shows that loss aversion, a phenomenon formalized in prospect theory, can explain a variety of field and experimental data. Quantifications of loss aversion are, however, hindered by the absence of a general preference-based method to elicit the utility for gains and losses simultaneously. This paper proposes such a method and uses it to measure loss aversion in an experimental study without making any parametric assumptions. Thus, it is the first to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect theory's utility function on the whole domain. Our method also provides an efficient way to elicit utility midpoints, which are important in axiomatizations of utility. Several definitions of loss aversion have been put forward in the literature. According to most definitions we find strong evidence of loss aversion, at both the aggregate and the individual level. The degree of loss aversion varies with the definition used, which underlines the need for a commonly accepted definition of loss aversion.

TI  - THE PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FUNCTION
PY  - 1998
AB  - A probability weighting finction w(p) is a prominent feature of several non-expected utility theories, including prospect theoiy and rank-dependent models. Empirical esti- mates indicate that w(p) is regressive (first w(p)>p, then iv(p)<p), s-shaped (first concave, then convex), and asymmetrical (intersecting the diagonal at about 1/3). The paper states axioms for several w(p) forms, including the compound invariant, w(p)= exp{ - { - ln p}1, 0 < a < 1, which is regressive, s-shaped, and with an invariant fixed point and inflection point at I/e = .37. THE COMMON-RATIO EFFECT (Allais (1953)) refers to the obselvation that the more risky of two simple prospects becomes relatively more attractive when the probability of winning is reduced by equal proportion in both prospects. Thus a person who prefers a sure gain of $100,000 over a coin toss for $300,000 or nothing, might also prefer a one-in-a-million lottery ticket for $300,000 over a two-in-a-million lottery ticket for $100,000. This contradicts expected utility but not common sense: There is a world of difference between certainty and a 50-50 shot; the difference between one or two chances in a million is negligible. The example has all the force and simplicity of classical arguments for nonlinear utility, where the utility interval from, say $10 and $20, is taken as self-evidently greater than the utility interval from $1,000,010 and $1,000,020. Both arguments appeal directly to our intuitions about numbers. A major point of difference is that the money argument involves a constant money intelval and the probability argument a constant probability ratio. A minor difference is that in the money domain a constant interval has less impact as the numbers get larger, while in the probability domain a constant ratio has less impact as the numbers get smaller. Putting the two demonstrations side by side like this raises an interesting question, namely, whether an account of nonlinearity-in-probabilities can be somehow adapted from classical utility theory (modulo a log transformation, converting statements about probability ratios into statements about utility intervals). Indeed, in their seminal paper on prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) explained the common-ratio effect by means of a nonlinear transformation of probabilities into "decision weights," p -* w(p), with log(w)

TI  - Prospect Theory
PY  - 2010
AB  - <jats:p>Prospect Theory: For Risk and Ambiguity, first published in 2010, provided the first comprehensive and accessible textbook treatment of the way decisions are made both when we have the statistical probabilities associated with uncertain future events (risk) and when we lack them (ambiguity). The book presents models, primarily prospect theory, that are both tractable and psychologically realistic. A method of presentation is chosen that makes the empirical meaning of each theoretical model completely transparent. Prospect theory has many applications in a wide variety of disciplines. The material in the book has been carefully organized to allow readers to select pathways through the book relevant to their own interests. With numerous exercises and worked examples, the book is ideally suited to the needs of students taking courses in decision theory in economics, mathematics, finance, psychology, management science, health, computer science, Bayesian statistics, and engineering.</jats:p>

TI  - Preference Foundations for Nonexpected Utility: A Generalized and Simplified Technique
PY  - 2003
AB  - This paper examines a tradeoff-consistency technique for testing and axiomatically founding decision models. The technique modifies earlier tradeoff-consistency techniques by only considering indifferences, not strict preferences. The resulting foundations are both more general and more accessible than earlier results, and they are so regarding both the technical and the intuitive axioms. Axiomatizations based on other, bisymmetry-like, conditions also follow as corollaries from the results of this paper. The tradeoff technique is applied to three popular theories of individual decision under uncertainty and risk, i.e., expected utility, Choquet expected utility, and prospect theory. The conditions used are better suited for empirical measurements of utility than earlier tradeoff conditions and, accordingly, are easier to test.

TI  - Testing Choquet expected utility
PY  - 1994
AB  - Many theories have been developed to model decision behavior under ambiguity. In this paper we empirically investigate Choquet expected utility, which is based on nonadditive probabilities. We first replicate Ellsberg paradox behavior. Then we elicit nonadditive probabilities (called capacities) for individual decision makers. Those capacities did not have all properties theoretically required by CEU. Finally we found that CEU is not really superior to EU in predicting the participants' decisions.

TI  - Estimating Ambiguity Aversion in a Portfolio Choice Experiment
PY  - 2013
AB  - We report a portfolio-choice experiment that enables us to estimate parametric models of ambiguity aversion at the level of the individual subject. The assets are Arrow securities corresponding to three states of nature, where one state is risky with known probability and two states are ambiguous with unknown probabilities. We estimate two specifications of ambiguity aversion, one kinked and one smooth that encompass many of the theoretical models in the literature. Each specification includes two parameters: one for ambiguity attitudes and another for risk attitudes. We also estimate a three-parameter specification that includes an additional parameter for pessimism/optimism (underweighting/overweighting the probabilities of different payoffs). The parameter estimates for individual subjects exhibit considerable heterogeneity. We cannot reject the null hypothesis of Subjective Expected Utility for a majority of subjects. Most of the remaining subjects exhibit statistically significant ambiguity aversion or seeking and/or pessimism or optimism.

TI  - Risk, Uncertainty and Profit
PY  - 1921
AB  - In Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, Frank Knight explored the riddle of profitability in a competitive market profit should not be possible under competitive conditions, as the entry of new entrepreneurs would drive prices down and nullify margins, however evidence abounds of competitive yet profitable markets. To explain this seeming paradox, Knight uncovers the distinction between calculable risk and essentially unknowable uncertainty. Knight argued that risk stems from repeated events, which therefore allow probabilities to be calculated and factored into decisions, as for instance insurers do. Uncertainty however, stems from events that are unpredictable and as such cannot be prepared against. According to Knight, it is the interplay between risk and uncertainty on the one hand and competition between incumbent and new entrepreneurs that accounts for the enormous variation in profitability across firms and, for the same firms, over time. His insights on the sources of profit have been instrumental in shaping modern economic theory and to the development of a useful understanding of probability. This New Edition has been typeset with modern techniques and contains a newly compiled Index of important topics. It has been painstakingly proofread to ensure that it is free from errors and that the content is faithful to the original.

TI  - PROSPECT THEORY: AN ANALYSIS OF DECISION UNDER RISK
PY  - 1979
AB  - This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob- abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY has dominated the analysis of decision making under risk. It has been generally accepted as a normative model of rational choice (24), and widely applied as a descriptive model of economic behavior, e.g. (15, 4). Thus, it is assumed that all reasonable people would wish to obey the axioms of the theory (47, 36), and that most people actually do, most of the time. The present paper describes several classes of choice problems in which preferences systematically violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In the light of these observations we argue that utility theory, as it is commonly interpreted and applied, is not an adequate descriptive model and we propose an alternative account of choice under risk. 2.

TI  - Uncertainty
PY  - 2008
AB  - This article deals with individual decision making under uncertainty (unknown probabilities). Risk (known probabilities) is not treated as a separate case, but as a sub-case of uncertainty. Many results from risk naturally extend to uncertainty. The Allais paradox, commonly applied to risk, also reveals empirical deficiencies of expected utility for uncertainty. The Ellsberg paradox reveals deviations from expected utility in a relative, not an absolute, sense, giving within-person comparisons: for some events (ambiguous or otherwise) subjects deviate more from expected utility than for other events. Besides aversion, many other attitudes towards ambiguity are empirically relevant.

TI  - Gifts as Economic Signals and Social Symbols
PY  - 1988
AB  - Gift-giving has often puzzled economists, especially because efficient gifts-like cash or giving exactly what a person asks for-seem crass or inappropriate. It is shown in a formal game-theoretic model that gifts serve as "signals" of a person's intentions about future investment in a relationship, and inefficient gifts can be better signals. Other explanations for the inefficiency of gift giving are advanced, and some stylized facts about gift-giving practices are described (many of which are consistent with the signaling view of gifts).

TI  - Pygmalion in Management
PY  - 2009
AB  - Most parents are aware that teachers'expectations about individual children become self-fulfilling prophecies: If a teacher believes a child is slow, the child will come to believe that, too, and will indeed learn slowly.The lucky child who strikes a teacher as bright also picks up on that expectation and will rise to fulfill it. This finding has been confirmed so many times, and in such varied settings, that it's no longer even debated. Self-fulfilling prophecies, it turns out, are just as prevalent in offices as they are in elementary school classrooms. If a manager is convinced that the people in her group are first-rate, they'll reliably outperform a group whose manager believes the reverse-even if the innate talent of the two groups is similar. J. Sterling Livingston named this 1969 article after the mythical sculptor who carves a statue of a woman that is brought to life. His title also pays homage to George Bernard Shaw, whose play Pygmalion explores the notion that the way one person treats another can, for better or worse, be transforming. In his article, Livingston notes that creating positive expectations is remarkably difficult, and he offers guidelines for managers: Focus special attention on an employee's first year because that's when expectations are set, make sure new hires get matched with outstanding supervisors, and set high expectations for yourself.

TI  - Labor Contracts as Partial Gift Exchange
PY  - 1982
AB  - This paper explains involuntary unemployment in terms of the response of firms to workers' group behavior. Workers' effort depends upon the norms determining a fair day's work. In order to affect those norms, firms may pay more than the market-clearing wage. Industries that pay consistently more than the market-clearing wage are primary, and those that pay only the market-clearing wage are secondary. Thus, this paper also gives a theory for division of labor markets between primary and secondary. INTRODUCTION In a study of social relations among workers at a utility company in the eastern United States, George Homans [1953, 1954] observed that a small group of young women (doing a job called “cash posting”) exceeded the minimum work standards of the firm by a significant margin (i.e., on average by 15 percent). Most of these women neither desired nor expected promotion in the firm in return for their troubles. Why did they do it? Section II shows that the standard neoclassical model cannot simultaneously explain both the behavior of the firm and the behavior of the cash posters. But, as shown in Section III, application of a standard sociological model does explain the behavior of both the young women and their employer. According to this model, in their interaction workers acquire sentiment for each other and also for the firm.

TI  - Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation
PY  - 2003
AB  - A central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives. For psychologists and sociologists, in contrast, rewards and punishments are often counterproductive, because they undermine "intrinsic motivation". We reconcile these two views, showing how performance incentives offered by an informed principal (manager, teacher, parent) can adversely impact an agent's (worker, child) perception of the task, or of his own abilities. Incentives are then only weak reinforcers in the short run, and negative reinforcers in the long run. We also study the effects of empowerment, help and excuses on motivation, as well as situations of ego bashing reflecting a battle for dominance within a relationship.

TI  - Why Wages Don't Fall During a Recession
PY  - 1999
AB  - A deep question in economics is why wages and salaries don't fall during recessions. this is not true of other prices, which adjust relatively quickly to reflect changes in demand and supply. Although economists have posited many theories to account for wage rigidity, none is satisfactory. eschewing "top-down" theorizing, the author explored the puzzle by interviewing - during the recession of the early 1990s - over 300 business executives and labour leaders as well as professional recruiters and advisors to the unemployed. By taking this approach, gaining the confidence of his interlocutors and asking them detailed questions in a nonstructured way, he was able to uncover empirically the circumstances that give rise to wage rigidity. He found that the executives were averse to cutting wages of either current employees or new hires, even during the economic downturn when demand for their products fell sharply. They believed that cutting wages would hurt morale, which they felt was critical in gaining the cooperation of their employees, and in convincing them to internalize the managers' objectives for the company. Bewley's findings contradict most theories of wage rigidity and provide fascinating insights into the problems businesses face that prevent labour markets from clearing.

TI  - When punishment fails: Research on sanctions, intentions and non-cooperation
PY  - 2008
AB  - People can become less cooperative when threatened with sanctions, and previous research has pointed to both "intentions" and incentives as sources of this effect. This paper reports data from a novel experiment aimed at determining the relative importance of intentions and incentives in producing non-cooperative behavior in a personal exchange environment. Subjects play a one-shot investment game in pairs. Investors send an amount to trustees and request a return on this investment and, in some treatments, are given the option to threaten sanctions to enforce this return request. The decisions of trustees who face credible threats intentionally imposed (or not) by their investors are compared to the decisions of trustees who face credible threats randomly imposed (or not) by nature. When not threatened, trustees typically decide to return a positive amount that is less than the investor requested. When threatened with sanctions this decision becomes least common. In particular, under severe sanction threats most trustees return the desired amount, while under weak threats the most common decision is to return nothing. These results do not depend on whether trustees are threatened intentionally by their investors or randomly by nature. We suggest that credible sanction threats generate a "cognitive shift" that crowd-out norm-based social behaviors and increase the likelihood of income-maximizing decisions.

TI  - Self-Fulfilling Prophecy as a Management Tool: Harnessing Pygmalion
PY  - 1984
AB  - A special case of self-fulfilling prophecy (SFP), the Pygmalion effect is the enhanced performance of subordinates of whom supervisors expect more. Pygmalion research in military and training situations is reviewed. Presented is a model of SFP at work involving supervisory expectancy, leadership, subordinate self-expectancy, motivation, and performance. Issues for future research and application are discussed, including how to raise expectations, which subordinates are influenced most, positive and negative Pygmalion, and ethical concerns.

TI  - Effects of Externally Mediated Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation.
PY  - 1971
AB  - Two laboratory experiments and one field experiment were conducted to investigate the effects of external rewards on intrinsic motivation to perform an activity. In each experiment, subjects were performing an activity during three different periods, and observations relevant to their motivation were made. External rewards were given to the experimental subjects during the second period only, while the control subjects received no rewards. Of interest was the difference in the experimental group's motivation between Period 1 and Period 3, relative to the difference in the control's. The results indicate that (a) when money was used as an external reward, intrinsic motivation tended to decrease, whereas (b) when verbal reinforcement and positive feedback were used, intrinsic motivation tended to increase. Discrepant findings in the literature were reconciled using a new theoretical framework which employs a cognitive approach and concentrates on the nature of the external reward. If a boy who enjoys mowing lawns begins to receive payment for the task, what will happen to his intrinsic motivation for performing this activity? Or, if he enjoys gardening and his parents seek to encourage this by providing verbal reinforcement and affection when he gardens, what will happen to his intrinsic motivation for gardening? These are examples of the classical problem concerning the effects of external rewards on intrinsic motivation. One is said to be intrinsically motivated to perform an activity when he receives no apparent rewards except the activity itself. This intrinsic motivation might be either innate or learned (White, 1959). It is not the purpose of this study to deal with the specific nature of, or development of, intrinsic motivation, but rather, it assumes that at a given time a person can be intrinsically motivated to do an activity, and it then asks: What are the effects of external rewards on this motivation ? In the two examples of the boy, he is performing the activity for no apparent rewards 1 These studies were conducted at Carnegie-Mell on University. The author wishes to thank Victor H. Vroom and Daryl J. Bern for helpful suggestions about the research and about earlier drafts of the manuscript.

TI  - Minimally acceptable altruism and the ultimatum game
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract I suppose that people react with anger when others show themselves not to be minimally altruistic. With heterogeneous agents, this can account for the experimental results of ultimatum and dictator games. Moreover, it can account for the surprisingly large fraction of individuals who offer an even split with parameter values that are more plausible than those that are required to explain outcomes in these experiments with the models of Levine [Levine, D.K., 1998. Modeling altruism and spitefulness in experiments. Review of Economic Dynamics 1, 593–622], Fehr and Schmidt [Fehr, E., Schmidt, K.M., 1999. A theory of fairness, competition and cooperation.

TI  - Do Incentive Contracts Undermine Voluntary Cooperation
PY  - NA
AB  - In this paper we provide experimental evidence indicating that incentive contracts may undermine voluntary cooperation. This suggests that explicit incentives may have costly side effects that have been largely neglected by economists. In our experiments the undermining effect is so strong that the incentive contracts are less efficient than contracts without any incentives. Buyers, who are in the role of principals, nonetheless, prefer the incentive contracts because they allow them tonappropriate a much larger share of the (smaller) total surplus and are, hence, more profitable for them. The undermining of voluntary cooperation through incentives is, in principle, consistent with models of inequity aversion and reciprocity. Additional experiments show, however, that the reduction of voluntary cooperation throughnincentives is partly due to a framing effect.

TI  - The Name of the Game: Predictive Power of Reputations versus Situational Labels in Determining Prisoner’s Dilemma Game Moves
PY  - 2004
AB  - Two experiments, one conducted with American college students and one with Israeli pilots and their instructors, explored the predictive power of reputation-based assessments versus the stated "name of the game" (Wall Street Game vs. Community Game) in determining players' responses in an N-move Prisoner's Dilemma. The results of these studies showed that the relevant labeling manipulations exerted far greater impact on the players' choice to cooperate versus defect--both in the first round and overall--than anticipated by the individuals who had predicted their behavior. Reputation-based prediction, by contrast, failed to discriminate cooperators from defectors. A supplementary questionnaire study showed the generality of the relevant short-coming in naive psychology. The implications of these findings, and the potential contribution of the present methodology to the classic pedagogical strategy of the demonstration experiment, are discussed.

TI  - IMPURE ALTRUISM AND DONATIONS TO PUBLIC GOODS: A THEORY OF WARM-GLOW GIVING*
PY  - 1990
AB  - When people make donations to privately provided public goods, such as charity, there may be many factors influencing their decision other than altruism. Social pressure, guilt, sympathy, or simply a desire for a "warm glow" may all be important. This paper considers such impure altruism formally and develops a wide set of implications. In particular, this paper discusses the invariance proposition of public goods, solves for the sufficient conditions for neutrality to hold, examines the optimal tax treatment of charitable giving, and calibrates the model based on econometric studies in order to consider policy experiments. Impure altruism is shown to be more consistent with observed patterns of giving than the conventional pure altruism approach, and to have policy implications that may differ widely from those of the conventional models.

TI  - A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation.
PY  - 1999
AB  - A meta-analysis of 128 studies examined the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. As predicted, engagement-contingent, completion-contingent, and performance-contingent rewards significantly undermined free-choice intrinsic motivation (d = -0.40, -0.36, and -0.28, respectively), as did all rewards, all tangible rewards, and all expected rewards. Engagement-contingent and completion-contingent rewards also significantly undermined self-reported interest (d = -0.15, and -0.17), as did all tangible rewards and all expected rewards. Positive feedback enhanced both free-choice behavior (d = 0.33) and self-reported interest (d = 0.31). Tangible rewards tended to be more detrimental for children than college students, and verbal rewards tended to be less enhancing for children than college students. The authors review 4 previous meta-analyses of this literature and detail how this study's methods, analyses, and results differed from the previous ones.

TI  - A theory of sequential reciprocity
PY  - 2004
AB  - Many experimental studies indicate that people are motivated by reciprocity. Rabin [Amer. Econ. Rev. 83 (1993) 1281] develops techniques for incorporating such concerns into game theory and economics. His theory is developed for normal form games, and he abstracts from information about the sequential structure of a strategic situation. We develop a theory of reciprocity for extensive games in which the sequential structure of a strategic situation is made explicit, and propose a new solution concept—sequential reciprocity equilibrium—for which we prove an equilibrium existence result. The model is applied in several examples, and it is shown that it captures very well the intuitive meaning of reciprocity as well as certain qualitative features of experimental evidence.

TI  - Social Image and the 50–50 Norm: A Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of Audience Effects
PY  - 2009
AB  - A norm of 50-50 division appears to have considerable force in a wide range of economic environments, both in the real world and in the laboratory. Even in settings where one party unilaterally determines the allocation of a prize (the dictator game), many subjects voluntarily cede exactly half to another individual. The hypothesis that people care about fairness does not by itself account for key experimental patterns. We consider an alternative explanation, which adds the hypothesis that people like to be perceived as fair. The properties of equilibria for the resulting signaling game correspond closely to laboratory observations. The theory has additional testable implications, the validity of which we confirm through new experiments.

PY  - 2006
AB  - We examine experimentally the impact of communication on trust and cooperation. Our design admits observation of promises, lies, and beliefs. The evidence is consistent with people striving to live up to others' expectations so as to avoid guilt, as can be modeled using psychological game theory. When players exhibit such guilt aversion, communication may influence motivation and behavior by influencing beliefs about beliefs. Promises may enhance trustworthy behavior, which is what we observe. We argue that guilt aversion may be relevant for understanding strategic interaction in a variety of settings, and that it may shed light on the role of language, discussions, agreements, and social norms in these contexts.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Models of giving have often been based on altruism. Examples include charity and intergenerational transfers. The literatures on both subjects have centered around neutrality hypotheses: charity is subject to complete crowding out, while intergenerational transfers are subject to Ricardian equivalence. This paper formally develops a model of giving in which altruism is not "pure." In particular, people are assumed to get a "warm glow" from giving. Contrary to the previous literature, this model generates identifiable comparative statics results that show that crowding out of charity is incomplete and that government debt will have Keynesian effects.

TI  - Incentives and Prosocial Behavior
PY  - 2006
AB  - We develop a theory of prosocial behavior that combines heterogeneity in individual altruism and greed with concerns for social reputation or self-respect. Rewards or punishments (whether material or imagerelated) create doubt about the true motive for which good deeds are performed and this “overjustification effect” can induce a partial or even net crowding out of prosocial behavior by extrinsic incentives. We also identify the settings that are conducive to multiple social norms and more generally those that make individual actions complements or substitutes, which we show depends on whether stigma or honor is (endogenously) the dominant reputational concern. Finally, we analyze the socially optimal level of incentives and how monopolistic or competitive sponsors depart from it. Sponsor competition is shown to potentially reduce social welfare.

TI  - Dynamic Psychological Games
PY  - 2009
AB  - The motivation of decision makers who care for emotions, reciprocity, or social conformity may depend directly on beliefs (about choices, beliefs, or information). Geanakoplos, Pearce & Stacchetti (Games and Economic Behavior, 1989) point out that traditional game theory is ill-equipped to address such matters, and they pioneer a new framework which does. However, their toolbox — psychological game theory — incorporates several restrictions that rule out plausible forms of belief-dependent motivation. Building on recent work on dynamic interactive epistemology, we propose a more general framework. Updated higher-order beliefs, beliefs of others, and plans of action may influence motivation, and we can capture dynamic psychological effects (such as sequential reciprocity, psychological forward induction, regret, and anxiety) that were previously ruled out. We develop solution concepts, provide examples, and explore properties.

AB  - We study peer effects in the workplace. Specifically, we investigate whether, how, and why the productivity of a worker depends on the productivity of coworkers in the same team. Using high-frequency data on worker productivity from a large supermarket chain, we find strong evidence of positive productiv ity spillovers from the introduction of highly productive personnel into a shift. Worker effort is positively related to the productivity of workers who see him, but not workers who do not see him. Additionally, workers respond more to the presence of coworkers with whom they frequently interact. We conclude that social pressure can partially internalize free-riding externalities that are built into many workplaces. (JEL J24, L81, M54)

TI  - Modeling Altruism and Spitefulness in Experiments
PY  - 1998
AB  - Abstract We examine a simple theory of altruism in which players' payoffs are linear in their own monetary income and their opponents. The weight on the opponent's income is private information and varies in the population, depending, moreover, on what the opponent's coefficient is believed to be. Using results of ultimatum experiments and the final round of a centipede experiment, we are able to pin down relatively accurately what the distribution of altruism (and spite) in the population is. This distribution is then used with a reasonable degree of success to explain the results of the earlier rounds of centipede and the results of some public goods contribution games. In addition, we show that in a market game where the theory of selfish players does quite well, the theory of altruism makes exactly the same predictions as the theory of selfish players.

TI  - DOES MONITORING INCREASE WORK EFFORT? THE RIVALRY WITH TRUST AND LOYALTY
PY  - 1993
AB  - Principal-agent theory suggests that tighter monitoring will raise an agent's work effort and will be applied provided that transaction costs are low. However, when a psychological contract exists between principals and agents, the agents perceive increased monitoring as an indication of distrust, and this induces them to reduce work effort. This “crowding out effect” is likely to dominate when the relationship between principals and agents is personal, while the “disciplining effect” is likely to dominate when the relationship is abstract, as in a competitive market setting. Empirical evidence from neighbouring sciences and from an econometric study supports this proposition.

Thereisalsostrong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games. Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free riders, stable cooperation is maintained, although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selesh types dominate equilibrium behavior.

PY  - 2007
AB  - An explanation for motivation crowding-out phenomena is developed in a social preferences framework. Besides selfish and fair or altruistic types, a third type of agent is introduced. These "conformists" have social preferences if they believe that sufficiently many of the others do as well. When there is asymmetric information about the distribution of preferences (the "social norm"), the incentive scheme offered or autonomy granted can reveal a principal's beliefs about that norm. High-powered incentives may crowd out motivation as pessimism about the norm is conveyed. But by choosing fixed wages or granting autonomy, trust in a favorable norm may be signaled.

PY  - 2004
AB  - We show experimentally that a principal's distrust in the voluntary performance of an agent has a negative impact on the agent's motivation to perform well. Before the agent chooses his performance, the principal in our experiment decides whether he wants to restrict the agents' choice set by implementing a minimum performance level for the agent. Since both parties have conflicting interests, restriction is optimal for the principal whenever the latter expects the agent to behave opportunistically. We find that most principals in our experiment do not restrict the agent's choice set but trust that the agent will perform well voluntarily. Principals who trust induce, on average, a higher performance and, hence, earn higher payoffs than principals who control. The reason is that most agents lower their performance as a response to the signal of distrust created by the principal's decision to limit their choice set. Our results shed new light on dysfunctional effects of explicit incentives, as well as, the puzzling incompleteness of many economic contracts.

TI  - Incomplete Contracts and Signaling
PY  - 1992
AB  - This article presents a principal-agent model in which asymmetric information leads to contractual incompleteness. I show that in the presence of transactions costs, incompleteness may act as a signal of the principal's type. Two types of transactions costs are considered: those incurred ex ante (drafting costs) and those incurred ex post (enforcement or verification costs). I prove that in the presence of either of these costs asymmetric information leads to more contractual incompleteness than full information does.

TI  - Attribution and Reciprocity in an Experimental Labor Market
PY  - 2004
AB  - The gift‐exchange game has established that, in the laboratory, higher wages offered by an employer lead to considerably more costly effort provision. However, it is unclear whether this behavior reflects reciprocity or other forms of social preferences. This article tests whether attribution of volition in choosing a wage has a significant effect on subsequent costly effort provision. Treatments varied whether wages were chosen by the employer or by an external process. We see that both distributional concerns and reciprocity play a major role. The data are examined in the light of recent utility models.

TI  - Understanding Social Preferences with Simple Tests
PY  - 2002
AB  - Departures from self-interest in economic experiments have recently inspired models of “social preferences”. We design a range of simple experimental games that test these theories more directly than existing experiments. Our experiments show that subjects are more concerned with increasing social welfare—sacrificing to increase the payoffs for all recipients, especially low-payoff recipients—than with reducing differences in payoffs (as supposed in recent models). Subjects are also motivated by reciprocity: They withdraw willingness to sacrifice to achieve a fair outcome when others are themselves unwilling to sacrifice, and sometimes punish unfair behavior.

TI  - A Social Exchange Approach to Voluntary Cooperation
PY  - 1990
AB  - A social exchange approach to voluntary cooperation is developed on the assumption that voluntary cooperative behavior is motivated by social approval, which is conceptualized as an emotional activity. The associated unique Nash equilibrium may have attractive welfare properties and provides an understanding of spontaneous norm emergence. Furthermore, the opening of a market or government intervention for the collective good is shown to affect voluntary cooperation negatively. Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association.

TI  - Pay Enough or Don't Pay at All
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract: Economics seems largely based on the assumption that monetary incentives improve performance. By contrast, a large literature in psychology, including a rich tradition of experimental work, claims just the opposite. In this paper we present and discuss a set of experiments designed to test the effect of different monetary compensations on performance. In our experiments we find that whenever money is offered, a larger amount yields a higher performance. It is not true, however, that offering money always induces a higher performance: participants who were offered a small payoff gave a worse performance than those who were offered no compensation at all. These results suggest that the behavior of participants is influenced by their perception of the contract that is offered to them. When the contract offers money the environment is perceived as monetary, and participants respond in a qualitatively different way in monetary and non-monetary environments. In a different set of experiments we test subjects who, acting as principals, have to provide the appropriate incentive to agents. We show that principals do not anticipate the drastic difference in behavior. The vast majority of principals seem to think incorrectly that a larger compensation is unambiguously a better incentive.

TI  - Incorporating Fairness into Game Theory and Economics
PY  - 1993
AB  - People like to help those who are helping them and to hurt those who are hurting them. Outcomes rejecting such motivations are called fairness equilibria. Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other's material payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other's payoffs. It is shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored. Copyright 1993 by American Economic Association.

TI  - A fine is a price
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract The deterrence hypothesis predicts that the introduction of a penalty that leaves everything else unchanged will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine. We present the result of a field study in a group of day‐care centers that contradicts this prediction. Parents used to arrive late to collect their children, forcing a teacher to stay after closing time. We introduced a monetary fine for late‐coming parents. As a result, the number of late‐coming parents increased significantly. After the fine was removed no reduction occurred. We argue that penalties are usually introduced into an incomplete contract, social or private. They may change the information that agents have, and therefore the effect on behavior may be opposite of that expected. If this is true, the deterrence hypothesis loses its predictive strength, since the clause “everything else is left unchanged” might be hard to satisfy.

TI  - More Order with Less Law: On Contract Enforcement, Trust, and Crowding
PY  - 2001
AB  - Most contracts, whether between voters and politicians or between house owners and contractors, are incomplete. “More law,” it typically is assumed, increases the likelihood of contract performance by increasing the probability of enforcement and/or the cost of breach. We examine a contractual relationship in which the first mover has to decide whether she wants to enter a contract without knowing whether the second mover will perform. We analyze how contract enforceability affects individual performance for exogenous preferences. Then we apply a dynamic model of preference adaptation and find that economic incentives have a nonmonotonic effect on behavior. Individuals perform a contract when enforcement is strong or weak but not with medium enforcement probabilities: Trustworthiness is “crowded in” with weak and “crowded out” with medium enforcement. In a laboratory experiment we test our model’s implications and find support for the crowding prediction. Our finding is in line with the recent work on the role of contract enforcement and trust in formerly Communist countries.

TI  - A Signaling Explanation for Charity
PY  - 1996
AB  - This article examines a novel but plausible motive for charitable giving. Charitable donations which are observable can signal wealth or income. The signaling equilibrium of charitable donations has attractive properties. Donations increase proportionally with population size. Governmental funding for public goods affects private charity only through an income effect. Crowding out need not be complete. Income redistribution is generically nonneutral. Increasing the spread between the poorest and richest person in a community tends to increase private donations. Our theory are based on the assumption that people are willing to make charitable donations even if they will not increase provision of the public good. The data on charitable giving support the hypothesis that donors donate at least partly for signaling purposes rather than only to aid the recipient or to obtain satisfactions unrelated to status. Though charitable organizations usually report donations within categories, thus not allowing perfect revelation, for analytical tractability we shall consider an equilibrium with perfect revelation and a continuum of types, as characterized in George J. Mailath (1987) and Norman J. Ireland (1994).

TI  - The False Consensus Effect: Deconstruction and Reconstruction of an Anomaly
PY  - 2004
AB  - We present a striking example of the deconstruction and reconstruction of an anomaly. In line with previous experiments we show in a one-shot setting that the allegedly robust false consensus e¤ect disappears if representative information is readily available. But the effect reappears if a small cognitive effort is required to retrieve the information. Most subjects apparently ignore valuable information if it is not handed to them on a silver platter. We conclude that the relevance of the false consensus effect depends on the difficulty of the information retrieval and that the underlying mechanism is an information processing defficiency rather than egocentricity. Moreover, we discuss the potential relevance of our findings for other well-known effects like the winner's curse and overconfidence.

TI  - INTERDEPENDENT PREFERENCES AND RECIPROCITY
PY  - 2005
AB  - Experiments, ethnography, and introspection provide evidence economic agents do not act to maximize their narrowly defined self interest. Expanding the domain of preferences to include the utility of others provides a coherent way to extend rational choice theory.There are two approaches for including extended or social preferences in strategic models. One posits that agents have extended preferences, but maintains the conventional assumption that these preferences are stable. Prominent examples of this approach permit agents to exhibit concern for status, inequality, and social welfare. The other approach permits the strategic context to determine the nature of individual preferences. Context-dependent preferences can capture the possibility that agents are motivated in part by reciprocity. They may sacrifice personal consumption in order to lower the utility of unkind agents or to raise the utility of kind agents.This paper surveys the evidence in favor of social preferences and describes the implications of the leading theoretical models of extended preferences. It presents behavioral assumptions that characterize different types of social preferences. It investigates the extent to which social preferences may arise as the limit of evolutionary processes. It discusses the relationship between norms of reciprocity and social preferences in repeated interactions.

TI  - THE HIDDEN COSTS AND RETURNS OF INCENTIVES—TRUST AND TRUSTWORTHINESS AMONG CEOs
PY  - 2004
AB  - We examine experimentally how Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) respond to incentives and how they provide incentives in situations requiring trust and trustworthiness. As a control we compare the behavior of CEOs with the behavior of students. We find that CEOs are considerably more trusting and exhibit more trustworthiness than students—thus reaching substantially higher efficiency levels than students. Moreover, we find that, for CEOs as well as for students, incentives based on explicit threats to penalize shirking backfire by inducing less trustworthy behavior—giving rise to hidden costs of incentives. However, the availability of penalizing incentives also creates hidden returns: if a principal expresses trust by voluntarily refraining fromimplementingthepunishmentthreat, theagentexhibitssignificantlymoretrustworthiness than if the punishment threat is not available. Thus trust seems to reinforce trustworthy behavior. Overall, trustworthiness is highest if the threat to punish is available but not used, while it is lowest if the threat to punish is used. Paradoxically, however, most CEOs and students use the punishment threat, although CEOs use it significantly less. (JEL: C91, C92, J30, J41)

TI  - On the Hidden Costs of Incentive Schemes
PY  - 2003
AB  - By enriching a principal-agent model it is shown that the introduction of monetary incentives may reduce an agent's motivation. In a first step, we allow for the possibility that some agents stick to unverifiable agreements. The larger the fraction of reliable agents, the lower powered will then be the optimal incentive scheme and fixed wages become optimal when performance measurement is costly. If social norms matter such that some agents' reliability is influenced by their beliefs on the convictions of others, high powered incentives signal that not sticking to agreements is a widespread behavior and may lead to lower effort levels. crowding-out, honesty

TI  - Incentives, Decision Frames, and Motivation Crowding Out - An Experimental Investigation
PY  - 2005
AB  - A simple principal agent problem is experimentally investigated in which a principal repeatedly sets a wage and an agent responds by choosing an effort level. The principal's payoff is determined by the agent's effort. In a first setting, the principal can only set a fixed wage in each period. In a second setting, the principal has the possibility to supplement the fixed wage with a piece rate. Surprisingly, efforts are lower in the case where piece rates can be paid. Furthermore, switching in the same treatment from a setting where piece rates are available to one where only fixed wages can be paid tends to lead to even lower effort levels. Based on our findings we suggest a new explanation for motivation crowding out by arguing that the use of piece rates considerably alters the principals' and agents' perception of the situation.

TI  - Continuous Preferences Can Cause Discontinuous Choices: An Application to the Impact of Incentives on Altruism
PY  - 2004
AB  - Implementing incentive systems can sometimes backfire in practice: experimental evidence and folklore both suggest that offers of explicit rewards can expose surprising discontinuities in behaviour. This Paper models two such discontinuities that have been claimed by psychologists and experimental economists to constitute important exceptions to the standard economic theory of human motivation. The first (‘type discontinuity’) is the observation of a discontinuity in the distribution across population types of values of the willingness to accept payment in return for performing certain (‘civic’) actions, such as giving blood or performing public service. It is claimed that this distribution is bimodal, even discontinuous: many people have a zero WTA, many have a large positive WTA, but nobody has a small positive WTA. The second (‘payment discontinuity’, also known as ‘crowding-out’) is that people who are willing to perform certain actions for free will refuse to perform them for a low price, even if they subsequently agree to perform them if the price is raised enough. Civic virtue may, on this view, be crowded out by the introduction of explicit incentives; people may stop doing things they were previously prepared to do without reward. The Paper shows that both phenomena may be observed as a result of individuals’ acting in a first period of public service in the knowledge that the terms of their action signal their type, and their type will affect a process of assortative matching in a second period. Type Discontinuity, but not Payment Discontinuity, is observed in a signaling game in which individuals announce the prices at which they will perform a civic action. Payment Discontinuity, but not Type Discontinuity, is observed in a screening game in which individuals have only a binary participation decision available to signal their type. The proportion of individuals participating when rewards are zero can be higher than when rewards are positive but small.

TI  - The Effect of Control Systems on Trust and Cooperation in Collaborative Environments
PY  - 2005
AB  - Because of conflicting incentives among participants, collaborations (e.g., strategic alliances, joint ventures, and work teams) present a significant control challenge to managerial accountants. On the one hand, formal controls such as sanctioning and monitoring systems improve cooperation by reducing the incentives for opportunistic behavior. On the other hand, prior research finds that the mere presence of a control system causes decision makers to view the collaborative setting as noncooperative, and other collaborators as untrustworthy. In this paper, we conduct two experiments in which participants act as business collaborators. Through these experiments, we examine the effects of control on trust and cooperation in collaborative settings. Specifically, we posit and provide evidence that a strong control system can enhance the level of trust among collaborators. The mediating role of control‐induced cooperation provides the mechanism by which control systems can increase trust in collaborative envir...

TI  - Competition and Incentives with Motivated Agents
PY  - 2005
AB  - A unifying theme in the literature on organizations such as public bureaucracies and private nonprofits is the importance of mission, as opposed to profit, as an organizational goal. Such mission-oriented organizations are frequently staffed by motivated agents who subscribe to the mission. This paper studies incentives in such contexts and emphasizes the role of matching the mission preferences of principals and agents in increasing organizational efficiency. Matching economizes on the need for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic conservatism and resistance to innovations. The framework developed in this paper is applied to school competition, incentives in the public sector and in private nonprofits, and the interdependence of incentives and productivity between the private for-profit sector and the mission-oriented sector through occupational choice. (JEL D23, D73, H41, L31) The late twentieth century witnessed a historic high in the march of market capitalism, with unbridled optimism in the role of the profit motive in promoting welfare in the production of private goods. Moreover, this generated a broad consensus on the optimal organization of private good production through privately owned competitive firms. When it comes to the provision of collective goods, no such consensus has emerged.' Debates about the relative merits of public and private provision still dominate. This paper suggests a contracting approach to the provision of collective goods. It focuses on two key issues: how to structure incentives, and the role of competition between providers. At its heart is the idea that organizations that provide collective goods cohere around a mission.2 Thus production of collective goods can be viewed as mission-oriented.

TI  - The Human Side of Enterprise
PY  - 1960
AB  - "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?" So began Douglas McGregor in this 1960 management classic. It was a seemingly simple question he asked, yet it led to a fundamental revolution in management. Today, with the rise of the global economy, the information revolution, and the growth of knowledge-driven work, McGregor's simple but provocative question continues to resonate-perhaps more powerfully than ever before. Heralded as one of the most important pieces of management literature ever written, a touchstone for scholars and a handbook for practitioners, The Human Side of Enterprise continues to receive the highest accolades nearly half a century after its initial publication. Influencing such major management gurus such as Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, McGregor's revolutionary Theory Y-which contends that individuals are self-motivated and self-directed-and Theory X-in which employees must be commanded and controlled-has been widely taught in business schools, industrial relations schools, psychology departments, and professional development seminars for over four decades. In this special annotated edition of the worldwide management classic, Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Senior Research Scientist in MIT's Sloan School of Management and Engineering Systems Division, shows us how today's leaders have successfully incorporated McGregor's methods into modern management styles and practices. The added quotes and commentary bring the content right into today's debates and business models. Now more than ever, the timeless wisdom of Douglas McGregor can light the path towards a management style that nurtures leadership capability, creates effective teams, ensures internal alignment, achieves high performance, and cultivates an authentic, value-driven workplace--lessons we all need to learn as we make our way in this brave new world of the 21st century.

TI  - Does Fairness Prevent Market Clearing? An Experimental Investigation
PY  - 1993
AB  - This paper reports the results of an experiment that was designed to test the impact of fairness on market prices. Prices were determined in a one-sided oral auction, with buyers as price-makers. Upon acceptance of an offer, sellers determined the quality of the good. Buyers offered prices that were substantially above the market-clearing level and expected sellers to respond with high quality levels. This expectation was, on average, confirmed by the behavior of sellers. These results provide, therefore, experimental support for the fair wage-effort theory of involuntary unemployment. I. INTRODUCTION Fairness is an elusive term. Yet, in actual business practice the parties involved in a transaction seem to refer quite frequently to the notion of fairness. This observation had already been made by Marshall [1925], who wrote: ". . . the phrase is constantly used in the market place; it is frequent in the mouths both of employers and the employed; and almost every phrase in common use has a real meaning, though it may be difficult to get at." In a recent study Blinder and Choi [1990] asked nineteen managers whether they and their workers would perceive a wage reduction to take advantage of labor market slack as (a) completely fair, (b) acceptable, (c) unfair, or (d) very unfair. While three managers considered this as an irrelevant question, all but one of the remaining sixteen said that such a wage cut is unfair or very unfair. Moreover, all but one believed that their workers would consider this wage cut as unfair or very unfair. In their study of community standards of fairness for the setting of prices and wages, Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler [1986] infer rules of fairness for conduct in the market from their interviewees' answers to hypothetical questions. Their empirical findings confirm the existence of such rules. However, what people say is one thing, but what they actually do may be quite a different thing. The possible divergence between

TI  - Managerial Incentive Problems: A Dynamic Perspective
PY  - 1999
AB  - The paper studies how a person's concern for a future career may influence his or her incentives to put in effort or make decisions on the job. In the model, the person's productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There are no explicit output-contingent contracts, but since the wage in each period is based on expected output and expected output depends on assessed ability, an "implicit contract" links today's performance to future wages. An incentive problem arises from the person's ability and desire to influence the learning process, and therefore the wage process, by taking unobserved actions that affect today's performance. The fundamental incongruity in preferences is between the individual's concern for human capital returns and the firm's concern for financial returns. The two need be only weakly related. It is shown that career motives can be beneficial as well as detrimental, depending on how well the two kinds of capital returns are aligned. It is well understood by now that informational externalities may place special demands on the organization of economic exchange. Simple price-mediated markets will frequently fail in the presence of asymmetric information. In that case more elaborate contractual arrangements have to be used as substitutes for the price system. Lately, considerable effort has been devoted to the analysis of contracting under incomplete information with the objective to understand the range of economic institutions that emerge in response to the failure of the price system. The analysis of moral hazard has played a prominent role in this development.' Moral hazard problems arise when, for some reason or another, transacting parties cannot contract contingent on the delivery of the good. For instance, in buying labour services it may be that the amount of labour supplied is not directly observable, precluding a simple exchange of wage for labour. As a partial remedy to this problem, an imperfect, mutually observed signal about the supply of labour can be used as a proxy in the contract. Frequently, output is taken as such a proxy. The drawback is that output is often influenced by other factors than labour input, which induce undesirable risk into the contract. One is therefore faced with a tradeoff between allocating risk associated with incomplete observability and providing incentives for a proper supply of labour. Gaining insight into this tradeoff is important not only for understanding contracting in the small (e.g. managerial incentive schemes), but also because it is closely related to the fundamental tension between equity and efficiency in the society as a whole. While our understanding of moral hazard has advanced a lot in past years, it is clear that much work remains. An important question that has received little attention until

TI  - Moral hazard and moral motivation: Corporate social responsibility as labor market screening
PY  - 2005
AB  - Morally motivated individuals behave more cooperatively than predicted by standard theory. Hence,if a firm can attract workers who are strongly motivated by ethical concerns, moral hazard problems like shirking can be reduced. We show that employers may be able to use the firm’s corporate social responsibility profile as a screening device to attract more productive workers. Both pooling and separating equilibria are possible. Even when a substantial share of the workers have no moral motivation whatsoever, such screening may in fact drive every firm with a low social responsibility profile out of business.

AB  - Abstract Research on ultimatum and dictator games has found that because of "fairness" first movers in such games offer more than noncooperative game theory predicts. We find that if the right to be the first mover is "earned" by scoring high on a general knowledge quiz, then first movers behave in a more self-regarding manner. We also conducted dictator double blind experiments, in which the experimenter could not identify the decision maker. The results yielded by far our largest observed incidence of self-regarding offers, suggesting that offers are due to strategic and expectation considerations.

TI  - Social “Facilitation” as Challenge and Threat
PY  - 1999
AB  - The authors conducted an experiment to test a theoretical explanation of social facilitation based on the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. Participants mastered 1 of 2 tasks and subsequently performed either the mastered (i.e., well-learned) or the unlearned task either alone or with an audience while cardiovascular responses were recorded. Cardiovascular responses of participants performing a well-learned task in the presence of others fit the challenge pattern (i.e., increased cardiac response and decreased vascular resistance), whereas cardiovascular responses of participants performing an unlearned task in the presence of others fit the threat pattern (i.e., increased cardiac response and increased vascular resistance), confirming the authors' hypotheses and the applicability of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat to explain these results.

TI  - The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation.
PY  - 1995
AB  - A hypothesized need to form and maintain strong, stable interpersonal relationships is evaluated in light of the empirical literature. The need is for frequent, nonaversive interactions within an ongoing relational bond. Consistent with the belongingness hypothesis, people form social attachments readily under most conditions and resist the dissolution of existing bonds. Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes. Lack of attachments is linked to a variety of ill effects on health, adjustment, and well-being. Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation. Several seeming counterexamples turned out not to disconfirm the hypothesis. Existing evidence supports the hypothesis that the need to belong is a powerful, fundamental, and extremely pervasive motivation.

TI  - Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work
PY  - 2002
AB  - Zahavi's1,2 handicap principle makes “waste” a common outcome of signal selection because the cost of a signal guarantees its honesty. The capacity to bear the cost reveals the show-off's hidden qualities. While displays take many forms, some also provide fitness-related benefits to the audience in addition to information about the show-off. Zahavi3 has used the handicap principle to explain both merely wasteful displays and altruistic behavior. Here we focus on the distinction between these two kinds of display and the importance of benefits other than information in show-off explanations of a particular puzzle in human evolution: men's work. Males of other primate species do not contribute any significant fraction of the food consumed by females and juveniles. Our own species is different. When people live on wild foods, hunting is usually a specialty of men, and meat is commonly a substantial component of everyone's diet. Here we explore the hypothesis that this unique male subsistence contribution may have evolved as hunting large animals became a focus of competitive display.

TI  - A Theory of Conformity
PY  - 1994
AB  - This paper analyzes a model of social interaction in which individuals care about status as well as "intrinsic" utility (which refers to utility derived directly from consumption). Status is assumed to depend on public perceptions about an individual's predispositions rather than on the individual's actions. However, since predispositions are unobservable, actions signal predispositions and therefore affect status. When status is sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals conform to a single, homogeneous standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous underlying preferences. They are willing to conform because they recognize that even small departures from the social norm will seriously impair their status. The fact that society harshly censures all nonconformists is not simply assumed (indeed, status varies smoothly with perceived type); rather, it is produced endogenously. Despite this penalty, agents with sufficiently extreme preferences refuse to conform. The model provides an ...

PY  - 2006
AB  - We study subjects who were asked to fill letters into envelopes with a remuneration independent of output. In the “pair” treatment, two subjects worked at the same time in the same room, and peer effects were possible. In the “single” treatment, subjects worked alone, and peer effects were ruled out. We find evidence of peer effects in the pair treatment because the standard deviations of output are smaller within pairs than between pairs. Moreover, average output is higher in the pair treatment: thus, peer effects raise productivity. Finally, low‐productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers.

TI  - The hidden costs of control
PY  - 2006
AB  - In this paper we analyze the behavioral consequences of control on motivation. Wenstudy a simple experimental principal-agent game, where the principal decides whethernhe controls the agent by implementing a minimum performance requirement before the agent chooses a productive activity. Our main finding is that a principal's decisionnto control has a negative impact on the agent's motivation. While there is substantial individual heterogeneity among agents, most agents reduce their performance as a response to the principals' controlling decision. The majority of the principals seem to anticipate the hidden costs of control and decide not to control. In several treatmentsnwe vary the enforceable level of control and show that control has a non-monotonic effect on the principal's payoff. In a variant of our main treatment principals can also set wages. In this gift-exchange game control partly crowds out agents' reciprocity. The economic importance and possible applications of our experimental results are further illustrated by a questionnaire study which reveals hidden costs of control in various real-life labor scenarios. We also explore possible reasons for the existence of hidden costs of control. Agents correctly believe that principals who control expect to get less than those who don't. When asked for their emotional perception of control, most agents who react negatively say that they perceive the controlling decision as a signal of distrust and a limitation of their choice autonomy.

AB  - Local opposition to many projects makes it increasingly difficult to find sites for socially desirable facilities. As has been widely documented, compensation for local disamenities does not increase the level of support. An empirical analysis of the Swiss search for a nuclear waste repository even reveals decreased acceptance due to the rejection of bribes and the crowding-out of public spirit. However, a "compensation cycle" may be exploited to finally win the support of host communities. As siting issues are decided in the realm of politics, an economic theory of compensation must focus on the interplay between morals and markets.

TI  - Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction
PY  - 2003
AB  - Game theory, the formalized study of strategy, began in the 1940s by asking how emotionless geniuses should play games, but ignored until recently how average people with emotions and limited foresight actually play games. This book marks the first substantial and authoritative effort to close this gap. Colin Camerer, one of the field's leading figures, uses psychological principles and hundreds of experiments to develop mathematical theories of reciprocity, limited strategizing, and learning, which help predict what real people and companies do in strategic situations. Unifying a wealth of information from ongoing studies in strategic behavior, he takes the experimental science of behavioral economics a major step forward. He does so in lucid, friendly prose.

	Behavioral game theory has three ingredients that come clearly into focus in this book: mathematical theories of how moral obligation and vengeance affect the way people bargain and trust each other; a theory of how limits in the brain constrain the number of steps of "I think he thinks . . ." reasoning people naturally do; and a theory of how people learn from experience to make better strategic decisions. Strategic interactions that can be explained by behavioral game theory include bargaining, games of bluffing as in sports and poker, strikes, how conventions help coordinate a joint activity, price competition and patent races, and building up reputations for trustworthiness or ruthlessness in business or life.

	While there are many books on standard game theory that address the way ideally rational actors operate, Behavioral Game Theory stands alone in blending experimental evidence and psychology in a mathematical theory of normal strategic behavior. It is must reading for anyone who seeks a more complete understanding of strategic thinking, from professional economists to scholars and students of economics, management studies, psychology, political science, anthropology, and biology.

TI  - Return on quality (ROQ): Making service quality financially accountable
PY  - 1995
AB  - Many companies have been disappointed by a lack of results from their quality efforts. The financial benefits of quality, which had been assumed as a matter of faith in the “religion of quality,” are now being seriously questioned by cost-cutting executives, who cite the highly publicized financial failures of some companies prominent in the quality movement. In this increasingly results-oriented environment, managers must now justify their quality improvement efforts financially. The authors present the “return on quality” approach, which is based on the assumptions that (1) quality is an investment, (2) quality efforts must be financially accountable, (3) it is possible to spend too much on quality, and (4) not all quality expenditures are equally valid. The authors then provide a managerial framework that can be used to guide quality improvement efforts. This framework has several attractive features, including ensured managerial relevance and financial accountability.

TI  - Aggregation Bias in Estimates of Perceptual Agreement.
PY  - 1982
AB  - Abstract : It is shown that estimates of agreement based on group mean scores have been incorrectly interpreted as applying to perceptual agreement among individuals. Of initial importance is a study by Drexler (1977), who concluded that a considerable proportion of the variance in climate perceptions is accounted for by organizational membership. This conclusion has been employed recently by other authors to support the assumption that individuals in the same environment tend to agree with respect to climate perceptions. The present paper demonstrates that Drexler's analysis provided inflated estimates of agreement among individuals. The logic of the approach is then extended to other studies in which inflated estimates of agreement appeared likely. (Author)

TI  - LOYAL FROM DAY ONE: BIODATA, ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION, AND TURNOVER AMONG NEWCOMERS
PY  - 1995
AB  - This paper attempts to use biodata to uncover behavioral and experiential antecedents of organizational identification (OID), and to demonstrate one way in which theory can be used in the development and analysis of objective biodata. The biodata correlates of organizational identification were assessed with a sample of 2,535 new U.S. Army recruits. Four biodata factors emerged: activities involving outdoor work or pastimes; a dependable, non-delinquent, lifestyle reflecting socialization to institutional expectations; a general preference for group attachments; and diligent involvement in intellectual pastimes. Results with a subset of 1,082 recruits revealed that both OID and the biodata antecedents predicted subsequent attrition across 6 time periods spanning 6 to 24 months. Results also revealed relatively high OID among the recruits.

TI  - Self‐categorization, affective commitment and group self‐esteem as distinct aspects of social identity in the organization
PY  - 2000
AB  - The purpose of this study is to distinguish between cognitive, affective and evaluative components of social identity in the organization and to show how the components instigate behaviours that benefit in-group members. A new scale for measuring cognitive organizational identification (i.e. self-categorization) is developed and compared to a leading scale. Internal consistency, convergent validity, predictive validity and generalizability of the two scales are established on a sample of Italian (N = 409) and Korean (N = 283) workers. Next, convergent and discriminant validity for measures of organizational identification, affective commitment and group self-esteem are demonstrated. Then, two antecedents of these components of social identity are examined: organization prestige and organization stereotypes. Finally, the mediating role of the components of social identity are investigated between the antecedents and five forms of citizenship behaviours. The last three analyses are performed on the Italian (N = 409) workers. Among other findings, the results show that affective commitment and self-esteem are the primary motivators of citizenship behaviours. Moreover, cognitive identification performs as a central mediator between prestige and stereotypes on the one hand, and affective commitment and self-esteem on the other. Identification is thus an indirect determinant of citizenship behaviours.

TI  - The Commitment-Trust Theory of Relationship Marketing
PY  - 1994
AB  - <jats:p> Relationship marketing—establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges—constitutes a major shift in marketing theory and practice. After conceptualizing relationship marketing and discussing its ten forms, the authors (1) theorize that successful relationship marketing requires relationship commitment and trust, (2) model relationship commitment and trust as key mediating variables, (3) test this key mediating variable model using data from automobile tire retailers, and (4) compare their model with a rival that does not allow relationship commitment and trust to function as mediating variables. Given the favorable test results for the key mediating variable model, suggestions for further explicating and testing it are offered. </jats:p>

TI  - Understanding Relationship Marketing Outcomes An Integration of Relational Benefits and Relationship Quality
PY  - 2002
AB  - The importance of developing and maintaining enduring relationships with customers of service businesses is generally accepted in the marketing literature. A key challenge for researchers is to identify and understand how managerially controlled antecedent variables influence important relationship marketing outcomes (e.g., customer loyalty and word-of-mouth communication). Relational benefits, which have a focus on the benefits consumers receive apart from the core service, and relationship quality, which focuses on the overall nature of the relationship, represent two approaches to understanding customer loyalty and word of mouth. This article integrates these two concepts by positioning customer satisfaction and commitment as relationship quality dimensions that partially mediate the relationship between three relational benefits (confidence benefits, social benefits, and special treatment benefits) and the two outcome variables. The results provide support for the model and indicate that the concepts ...

PY  - 1997
AB  - Emerging theory and empirics in personality psychology have related enduring traits with transient affective experiences or states. The research reported in this article integrates these findings with recent consumer research models linking consumption-based emotions with consumer satisfaction and postpurchase behaviors (including complaints, recommendations, and repeat purchase intentions). Our results support a model relating broad, fundamental personality traits to specific consumer behaviors via mediating affective experiences. These findings may help identify consumer segments inclined toward satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and consequently, toward loyalty, word of mouth, and complaining. Further, they suggest a general approach for relating broad traits to specific behaviors by incorporating mediating processes. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Linking Service Climate and Customer Perceptions of Service Quality: Test of a Causal Model
PY  - 1998
AB  - A set of foundation issues that support employee work and service quality is conceptualized as a necessary but not sufficient cause of a climate for service, which in turn is proposed to be reflected in customer experiences. Climate for service rests on the foundation issues, but in addition it requires policies and practices that focus attention directly on service quality. Data were collected at multiple points in time from employees and customers of 134 branches of a bank and analyzed via structural equation modeling. Results indicated that the model in which the foundation issues yielded a climate for service, and climate for service in turn led to customer perceptions of service quality, fit the data well. However, subsequent cross-lagged analyses revealed the presence of a reciprocal effect for climate and customer perceptions. Implications of these results for theory and research are offered.

TI  - The link between salespeople’s job satisfaction and customer satisfaction in a business-to-business context: A dyadic analysis
PY  - 2004
AB  - Although it has frequently been argued that the job satisfaction of a company’s employees is an important driver of customer satisfaction, systematic research exploring this link is scarce. The present study investigates this relationship for salespeople in a business-to-business context. The theoretical justification for a positive impact of salespeople’s job satisfaction on customer satisfaction is based on the concept of emotional contagion. The analysis is based on a dyadic data set that involves judgments provided by salespeople and their customers collected across multiple manufacturing and services industries. Results indicate the presence of a positive relationship between salespeople’s job satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the relationship between salespeople’s job satisfaction and customer satisfaction is found to be particularly strong in the case of high frequency of customer interaction, high intensity of customer integration into the value-creating process, and high product/service innovativeness.

We develop a model to explain how images of one's work organization shape the strength of his or her identification with the organization. We focus on two key organizational images: one based on what a member believes is distinctive, central, and enduring about his or her organization and one based on a member's beliefs about what outsiders think about the organization. According to the model, members assess the attractiveness of these images by how well the image preserves the continuity of their self-concept, provides distinctiveness, and enhances self-esteem. The model leads to a number of propositions about how organizational identification affects members' patterns of social interaction.'

PY  - 2002
AB  - Psychology's study of the self-concept has generated numerous paradigms with different underlying assumptions. In this article it is argued that these assumptions must be considered before a self-concept paradigm can be meaningfully applied to consumer research. The major premise in this article is that the recent work on social identity is a particularly meaningful paradigm to adopt for consumer research that implicates the self. This argument is developed with a conceptual discussion of major self-concept issues, an overview of basic self-concept paradigms in psychology, and a synthesis of possible factors that may be considered in future theories of social-identity–based consumption decision making. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - In‐group prototypicality and persuasion: Determinants of heuristic and systematic message processing
PY  - 1994
AB  - Self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher & Wetherell, 1987) proposes that identification with a social group will elicit a tendency to conform to in-group norms. Following this proposition, we argue that the extent to which persuasive in-group communication is perceived to reflect in-group norms, that is, is prototypical, will affect attitudes. Attitudes are predicted to be more affected by exposure to prototypical messages. Moreover, it is argued that prototypicality might both instigate systematic message processing and function as a heuristic cue. Whether systematic processing will occur was hypothesized to be dependent on the availability of cues enabling heuristic processing. A study was designed in which subjects were exposed to a persuasive message from either a prototypical or an non-prototypical in-group source. In half of the conditions, subjects were informed about the opinion of the source before message exposure (which would enable heuristic processing). Quality of the message (i.e. strong vs. weak arguments) and position advocated by the message were experimentally varied. It was predicted that prototypicality would elicit conformity to in-group norms, but that it would only instigate systematic processing when subjects had no foreknowledge about the source opinion. Results supported these predictions

TI  - Customer Satisfaction, Productivity, and Profitability: Differences Between Goods and Services
PY  - 1997
AB  - There is widespread belief that firms should pursue superiority in both customer satisfaction and productivity. However, there is reason to believe these two goals are not always compatible. If a firm improves productivity by “downsizing,” it may achieve an increase in productivity in the short-term, but future profitability may be threatened if customer satisfaction is highly dependent on the efforts of personnel. If so, there are potential tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity for industries as diverse as airlines, banking, education, hotels, and restaurants. Managers in these types of service industries, as well as goods industries in which the service component is increasing, need to understand whether or not this is the case. For example, if efforts to improve productivity can actually harm customer satisfaction---and vice-versa---the downsizing of U.S. and European companies should be viewed with concern. It follows that developing a better understanding of how customer satisfaction and productivity relate to one another is of substantial and growing importance, especially in light of expected continued growth in services throughout the world economy.

The objective of this paper is to investigate whether there are conditions under which there are tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity. A review of the literature reveals two conflicting viewpoints. One school of thought argues that customer satisfaction and productivity are compatible, as improvements in customer satisfaction can decrease the time andeffort devoted to handling returns, rework, warranties, and complaint management, while at the same time lowering the cost of making future transactions. The second argues that increasing customer satisfaction should increase costs, as doing so often requires efforts to improve product attributes or overall product design.

A conceptual framework useful in resolving these contradictory viewpoints is developed. The framework serves, in turn, as a basis for developing a theoretical model relating customer satisfaction and productivity. The model predicts that customer satisfaction and productivity are less likely to be compatible when: 1 customer satisfaction is relatively more dependent on customization---the degree to which the firm's offering is customized to meet heterogeneous customers' needs---as opposed to standardization---the degree to which the firm's offering is reliable, standardized, and free from deficiencies; and 2 when it is difficult costly to provide high levels of both customization and standardization simultaneously.

To move forward from the model's propositions to the development of testable hypotheses, we argue that services are more likely than goods to have the preceding characteristics. Hence, tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity should be more prevalent for services than for goods. Although this classification is not precise---many services are standardizable and many goods have a service component---it has the advantage of allowing an initial test of the propositions.

The empirical work employs a database matching customer-based measures of firm performance with traditional measures of business performance, such as productivity and Return on Investment ROI. The central feature of this database is the set of customer satisfaction indices provided by the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer SCSB. The SCSB provides a uniform set of comparable customer-based firm performance measures and offers a unique opportunity to test the study's hypotheses.

The findings indicate that the association between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in productivity is positive for goods, but negative for services. In addition, while both customer satisfaction and productivity are positively associated with ROI for goods and services, the interaction between the two is positive for goods but significantly less so for services.

Taken together, the findings suggest support for the contention that tradeoffs are more likely for services. Hence, simultaneous attempts to increase both customer satisfaction and productivity are likely to be more challenging in such industries. Of course, this does not imply that such firms should not seek improvements in both productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, appropriate applications of information technology may improve both customer satisfaction and productivity simultaneously.

The findings should provide motivation for future research concerning the nature of customer satisfaction and productivity, as well as appropriate strategy and tactics for each one. It is worth emphasizing that this is an issue that is not only important today, but certainly will become even more important in the future. As the growth of services continues and world markets become increasingly competitive, the importance of customer satisfaction will also increase. To compete in such a world, firms must strike the right balance between their efforts to compete efficiently and their efforts to compete effectively.

TI  - Antecedents and consequences of customer-company identification: expanding the role of relationship marketing.
PY  - 2005
AB  - This article presents an empirical test of organizational identification in the context of customer-company (C-C) relationships. It investigates whether customers identify with companies and what the antecedents and consequences of such identification are. The model posits that perceived company characteristics, construed external image, and the perception of the company's boundary-spanning agent lead to C-C identification. In turn, such identification is expected to impact both in-role behavior (i.e., product utilization) as well as extra-role behavior (i.e., citizenship). The model was tested in a consultative selling context of pharmaceutical sales reps calling on physicians. Results from the empirical test indicated that customers do indeed identify with organizations and that C-C identification positively impacts both product utilization behavior and extra-role behavior even when the effect of brand perception is accounted for. Second, the study found that the organization's characteristics as well as the salesperson's characteristics contributed to the development of C-C identification.

TI  - Satisfying and Retaining Customers through Independent Service Representatives
PY  - 2004
AB  - The degree of leverage possessed by manufacturers who outsource their customer service function to channel partners over customer satisfaction and loyalty is assessed empirically. Data provided by independent service representatives are linked with data from their customers. Results indicate that a manufacturer's support of its representatives increases their job satisfaction which, in turn, is indirectly linked to the customer satisfaction through shared perceptions of service performance and quality. However, the strength of the effects is modest, suggesting that manufacturers may need to consider direct customer contact strategies or contractual means of assuring customer satisfaction when independent service representatives “own the customer.” Conceptually, the hypothesized shared mindset model is tested against the competing affect transfer model, resulting in support for the former. Job satisfaction moderates the degree of agreement between representatives' and customers' perceptions of service performance and quality such that greater agreement occurs when job satisfaction is high.

TI  - Understanding the Bond of Identification: An Investigation of its Correlates among Art Museum Members
PY  - 1995
AB  - <jats:p> Identification is defined as the “perceived oneness with or belongingness to an organization” of which the person is a member. The authors propose that customers, in their role as members, identify with organizations. They use social identity theory to propose and test a model that relates members’ identification with the focal organization to (1) organizational and product characteristics, (2) members’ affiliation characteristics, and (3) members’ activity characteristics. Their empirical setting consists of the members of an art museum. Their survey findings show that members’ identification is positively related to perceived organizational prestige, donating activity, tenure of membership, visiting frequency, and confirmation of member expectations with the organization's services. However, members’ participation in similar organizations is negatively related to identification with the focal organization. The authors discuss how this study can be extended to other marketing contexts and how managers can use the notion of identification in implementing marketing strategies. </jats:p>

PY  - 1999
AB  - <jats:p> Several theories of relationship marketing propose that customers vary in their relationships with a firm on a continuum from transactional to highly relational bonds. Few empirical studies have segmented the customer base of an organization into low and high relational groups to assess how evaluations vary for these groups. Using structural equation analysis, the authors analyze the relationships of satisfaction, trust, and commitment to component satisfaction attitudes and future intentions for the customers of a New York off-Broadway repertory theater company. For the low relational customers (individual ticket buyers and occasional subscribers), overall satisfaction is the primary mediating construct between the component attitudes and future intentions. For the high relational customers (consistent subscribers), trust and commitment, rather than satisfaction, are the mediators between component attitudes and future intentions. </jats:p>

In addition, the second study examines dynamic aspects of the relationship and provides evidence for the stronger impact of cumulative satisfaction rather than of transaction-specific satisfaction on willingness to pay.

The authors find that three retail employee job perceptions (conscientiousness, perceived organizational justice, and organizational identification) have main and interactive effects on three dimensions of employee job performance (in-role performance, extra-role performance toward customers, and extra-role performance toward the organization). In turn, these performance dimensions exert influence on customer evaluations of the retailer (a satisfaction, purchase intent, loyalty, and word-of-mouth composite). The authors also show that employee perceptions exert a direct influence on customer evaluations, and that customer evaluations affect retail store performance (customer spending and comparable store sales growth).

Finally, the authors conduct some simple simulations that show: (1) how changes in employee perceptions may raise average employee performances; (2) how changes in employee performances enhance average customer evaluations; and (3) how changes in customer evaluations raise average customer spending and comparable store sales growth. The authors then show that employee job perceptions and performances “ripple thru the system” to affect customer spending and store sales growth. The authors offer implications for theory and practice.

TI  - Response Determinants in Satisfaction Judgments
PY  - 1988
AB  - The effects of five determinants of satisfaction are tested as well as individual differences in satisfaction formation. Manipulations of attribution, expectancy, performance, disconfirmation, and equity are written into stock market trading scenarios in a full factorial design. Results show that all main effects and four ordinal two-way interactions are significant. Then, an individual-level analysis is performed on the repeated measures data. Three clusters of subjects sharing similar response tendencies (disconfirmation, performance, and equity) are identified and related to investment attitudes, outcome attitudes, and demographics. No consistent relationships are discovered, suggesting that the response differences reflect deeper behavioral tendencies. Implications of this approach for satisfaction paradigms, satisfaction theory, and individual satisfaction response orientations are presented.

TI  - Business-unit-level relationship between employee satisfaction, employee engagement, and business outcomes: a meta-analysis.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Based on 7,939 business units in 36 companies, this study used meta-analysis to examine the relationship at the business-unit level between employee satisfaction-engagement and the business-unit outcomes of customer satisfaction, productivity, profit, employee turnover, and accidents. Generalizable relationships large enough to have substantial practical value were found between unit-level employee satisfaction-engagement and these business-unit outcomes. One implication is that changes in management practices that increase employee satisfaction may increase business-unit outcomes, including profit.

TI  - Effects of service provider attitudes and employment status on citizenship behaviors and customers' attitudes and loyalty behavior.
PY  - 2006
AB  - The relationship among job satisfaction, affective commitment, service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty were examined for a sample of 249 hairstylists and 1 of their corresponding customers. Employee satisfaction was positively related to service-oriented OCBs, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty, whereas affective commitment was not related to these outcomes. The extent to which the predictor variables interacted with one another and the role of employment status on these relationships was also explored. High levels of job satisfaction or affective commitment resulted in more service-oriented OCBs for employees and self-employed workers, whereas high levels of both resulted in more service-oriented OCBs for owners.

TI  - Employee Satisfaction, Customer Loyalty, and Financial Performance: An Empirical Examination of the Service Profit Chain in Retail Banking
PY  - 1998
AB  - The service profit chain is a simple conceptual framework linking employee satisfaction and loyalty, customer satisfaction and loyalty, and financial performance. Although widely used by practitioners, the service profit chain's series of hypothesized relationships between employee, customer, and financial outcomes has not been rigorously tested using data that span all components of the model. Panel data from the branches of a large regional bank are used to test individually each of the service profit chain's constituent hypotheses. The results generally support the model, but there are some exceptions. Further work is needed to refine and simplify several critical measures and to enhance the analysis to test the service profit chain as a complete system of related hypotheses.

largely neglected the issue of moderator variables. The authors develop a set of
hypotheses related to the moderating effect of selected personal characteristics on the
satisfaction-loyalty link. These hypotheses are tested in a consumer durables context
using multiple group causal analysis. Empirical findings provide reasonable support for
the theoretical arguments. Specifically, variety seeking, age, and income are found to be
important moderators of the satisfaction-loyalty relationship.

TI  - International Review of Industrial and Organizational Psychology 2004 - MY JOB IS MY CASTLE: IDENTIFICATION IN ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXTS
PY  - 2003
AB  - Due to growing globalization, cross-national alliances, (international) organizational mergers, restructuring, delayering, or outsourcing, one could assume that the psychological bond between employee and employing organization has become weaker. Also, new forms of work and enterprises like telecommuting or other types of virtual organizations should psychologically distract employees even more from their organizations. One could also argue, however, that some kind of psychological attachment between organization and organizational member is more important for both the individual’s well-being and the organization’s success because of these rapid changes. The present overview of organizational identification argues in exactly this direction and holds some empirical evidence for this (e.g., Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, & Garud, 2001). The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the antecedents, elements, and consequences of social identification in organizational contexts and thus the relevance of the concept for the analysis of organizational behavior. This will be done particularly in two domains where change processes are going on steadily and increasingly— organizational mergers and group productivity.

TI  - Attribute-Level Performance, Satisfaction, and Behavioral Intentions over Time: A Consumption-System Approach
PY  - 1999
AB  - <jats:p> Instead of offering products or services alone, increasingly, firms and their partners are offering consumption systems. Consumption systems are offerings characterized by a significant product and service subsystem, as well as a pattern of consumption in which consumption occurs in multiple episodes over time. The authors develop a theoretical model for conceptualizing satisfaction with consumption systems and empirically test it using longitudinal data from 5206 automobile owners. Results show that an intertemporal examination of attribute-level performance, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions can improve an understanding of their relationships because these relationships change as the consumption of the product unfolds. For example, on the basis of their salience, attribute weights in determining satisfaction shift over time. Furthermore, the crossover effect of product and service satisfaction in determining intentions toward the manufacturer and the service provider is asymmetric, and this asymmetry reverses over time. Service satisfaction initially has a much larger impact in determining intentions toward the manufacturer, but later, product satisfaction is more influential in generating intentions toward the service provider and manufacturer. The results show that there is no direct link between satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Rather, satisfaction affects behavioral intentions in the future through a dual-mediation route. </jats:p>

TI  - Organizational identification versus organizational commitment: self-definition, social exchange, and job attitudes
PY  - 2006
AB  - The psychological relationship between individual and organization has been conceptualized both in terms of identification and in terms of (affective) commitment. In the present study, we explore the differences between these two conceptualizations. Building on the proposition that identification is different from commitment in that identification reflects the self-definitional aspect of organizational membership whereas commitment does not, we propose that commitment is more contingent on social exchange processes that presume that individual and organization are separate entities psychologically, and more closely aligned with (other) job attitudes. In support of these propositions, results of a cross-sectional survey of university faculty (n=133) showed that identification is uniquely aligned (i.e., controlling for affective commitment) with the self-referential aspect of organizational membership, whereas commitment is uniquely related (i.e., controlling for identification) to perceived organizational support, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. We conclude that the core difference between identification and commitment lies in the implied relationship between individual and organization: Identification reflects psychological oneness, commitment reflects a relationship between separate psychological entities.

TI  - WORK MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE: A SOCIAL IDENTITY PERSPECTIVE
PY  - 2000
AB  - Work motivation and performance were analysed from the perspective of social identity theory and self-categorisation theory. Central in this analysis is the relation of organisational identification with the motivation to exert effort on behalf of the collective. A theoretical analysis as well as a review of empirical studies of the relationship of organisational identification with motivation and performance leads to the conclusion that identification is positively related to work motivation, task performance, and contextual performance to the extent that (a) social identity is salient, and (b) high performance is perceived to be in the group’s or organisation’s interest.

TI  - THE ANTECEDENTS, CONSEQUENCES AND MEDIATING ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY
PY  - 2004
AB  - We investigated contextual organizational ambidexterity, defined as the capacity to simultaneously achieve alignment and adaptability at a business-unit level. Building on the leadership and organization context literatures, we argue that a context characterized by a combination of stretch, discipline, support, and trust facilitates contextual ambidexterity. Further, ambidexterity mediates the relationship between these contextual features and performance. Data collected from 4,195 individuals in 41 business units supported our hypotheses. A recurring theme in a variety of organizational literatures is that successful organizations in a dynamic environment are ambidextrous—aligned and efficient in their management of today’s business demands, while also adaptive enough to changes in the environment that they will still be around tomorrow (Duncan, 1976; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). The simple idea behind the value of ambidexterity is that the demands on an organization in its task environment are always to some degree in conflict (for instance, investment in current versus future projects, differentiation versus low-cost production), so there are always trade-offs to be made. Although these trade-offs can never entirely be eliminated, the most successful organizations reconcile them to a large degree, and in so doing enhance their long-term competitiveness. Authors have typically viewed ambidexterity in structural terms. According to Duncan (1976), who first used the term, organizations manage trade-offs between conflicting demands by putting in place “dual structures,” so that certain business units—or groups within business units—focus on alignment, while others focus on adaptation (Duncan, 1976).

TI  - Corridors of Influence in the Dissemination of Customer-Oriented Strategy to Customer Contact Service Employees
PY  - 2000
AB  - <jats:p> It is widely held that a customer-oriented firm is more likely to deliver exceptional service quality and create satisfied customers. However, little research has addressed the question of how the orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm. This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e., formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that there are three “corridors of influence” between customer-oriented strategy and shared employee values. The dominant corridor, which focuses on dual (management- and employee-initiated) control, emphasizes the importance of work group socialization and organizational commitment in the dissemination of customer-oriented strategy. A secondary corridor focuses on two management-initiated control mechanisms: formalization and behavior-based evaluation. The final corridor, which focuses on the empowerment of customer contact employees, has a more limited impact than originally hypothesized. The authors discuss implications for the implementation of customer-oriented strategy and the management of customer contact employees, along with several directions for further research. </jats:p>

TI  - The Management of Customer-Contact Service Employees: An Empirical Investigation
PY  - 1996
AB  - <jats:p> The authors develop and test a model of service employee management that examines constructs simultaneously across three interfaces of the service delivery process: manager-employee, employee-role, and employee-customer. The authors examine the attitudinal and behavioral responses of customer-contact employees that can influence customers’ perceptions of service quality, the relationships among these responses, and three formal managerial control mechanisms (empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and management commitment to service quality). The findings indicate that managers who are committed to service quality are more likely to empower their employees and use behavior-based evaluation. However, the use of empowerment has both positive and negative consequences in the management of contact employees. Some of the negative consequences are mitigated by the positive effects of behavior-based employee evaluation. To increase customers’ perceptions of service quality, managers must increase employees’ self-efficacy and job satisfaction, and reduce employees’ role conflict and ambiguity. Implications for the management of customer-contact service employees and directions for further research are discussed. </jats:p>

AB  - It is argued that (a) social identification is a perception of oneness with a group of persons; (b) social identification stems from the categorization of individuals, the distinctiveness and prestige of the group, the salience of outgroups, and the factors that traditionally are associated with group formation; and (c) social identification leads to activities that are congruent with the identity, support for institutions that embody the identity, stereotypical perceptions of self and others, and outcomes that traditionally are associated with group formation, and it reinforces the antecedents of identification. This perspective is applied to organizational socialization, role conflict, and intergroup relations.

AB  - The authors develop a longitudinal model of the effect of a service change on customer attitudes about service quality. The model is estimated with data from a field experiment with three survey waves. Service changes are found to have a strong influence on customer evaluations of service quality through their effect on customer perceptions of current performance and disconfirmation. The effect of disconfirmation is larger and the effect of prior attitudes is smaller directly after the service change than in a subsequent time period.

PY  - 1996
AB  - <jats:p> The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is a new type of market-based performance measure for firms, industries, economic sectors, and national economies. The authors discuss the nature and purpose of ACSI and explain the theory underlying the ACSI model, the nation-wide survey methodology used to collect the data, and the econometric approach employed to estimate the indices. They also illustrate the use of ACSI in conducting benchmarking studies, both cross-sectionally and over time. The authors find customer satisfaction to be greater for goods than for services and, in turn, greater for services than for government agencies, as well as find cause for concern in the observation that customer satisfaction in the United States is declining, primarily because of decreasing satisfaction with services. The authors estimate the model for the seven major economic sectors for which data are collected. Highlights of the findings include that (1) customization is more important than reliability in determining customer satisfaction, (2) customer expectations play a greater role in sectors in which variance in production and consumption is relatively low, and (3) customer satisfaction is more quality-driven than value- or price-driven. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of ACSI for public policymakers, managers, consumers, and marketing in general. </jats:p>

TI  - The service-driven service company.
PY  - 1991
AB  - For more than 40 years, service companies like McDonald's prospered with organizations designed according to the principles of traditional mass-production manufacturing. Today that model is obsolete. It inevitably degrades the quality of service a company can provide by setting in motion a cycle of failure that produces dissatisfied customers, unhappy employees, high turnover among both--and so lower profits and lower productivity overall. The cycle starts with human resource policies that minimize the contributions frontline workers can make: jobs are designed to be idiot-proof. Technology is used largely for monitoring and control. Pay is poor. Training is minimal. Performance expectations are abysmally low. Today companies like Taco Bell, Dayton Hudson, and ServiceMaster are reversing the cycle of failure by putting workers with customer contact first and designing the business system around them. As a result, they are developing a model that replaces the logic of industrialization with a new service-driven logic. This logic: Values investments in people as much as investments in technology--and sometimes more. Uses technology to support the efforts of workers on the front lines, not just to monitor or replace them. Makes recruitment and training crucial for everyone. Links compensation to performance for employees at every level. To justify these investments, the new logic draws on innovative data such as the incremental profits of loyal customers and the total costs of lost employees. Its benefits are becoming clear in higher profits and higher pay--results that competitors bound to the old industrial model will not be able to match.

TI  - Organizational Obstacles: Links with Financial Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Job Satisfaction in a Service Environment
PY  - 1993
AB  - A model was developed to describe the roles of organizational obstacles (social and technical) in relation to three types of performance outcomes (customer satisfaction, financial performance, and employee job satisfaction), as well as to various moderators associated with different job types (e.g., customer contact, organizational commitment). In a test of this model, employee perceptions of organizational obstacles were measured in a retail banking environment. For employees in highest contact with customers (i.e., tellers), reports of co-worker obstacles, work environment obstacles, and workbreak scheduling obstacles were associated with lower levels of customer satisfaction. However, there was very little relationship between tellers' perceptions of obstacles and tellers' job satisfaction. For employees in positions associated with more experience and commitment (i.e., account representatives), information timeliness obstacles were linked with higher customer satisfaction, while materials, workspace s...

TI  - Motivating Individuals and Groups at Work: A Social Identity Perspective on Leadership and Group Performance
PY  - 2004
AB  - We argue that additional understanding of work motivation can be gained by incorporating current insights concerning self-categorization and social identity processes and by examining the way in which these processes influence the motivation and behavior of individuals and groups at work. This theoretical perspective that focuses on the conditions determining different self-definitions allows us to show how individual and group processes interact to determine work motivation. To illustrate the added value of this approach, we develop some specific propositions concerning motivational processes underpinning leadership and group performance.

TI  - Return on Marketing: Using Customer Equity to Focus Marketing Strategy
PY  - 2004
AB  - The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm’s customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm’s customer equity is the change in its current and future customers’ lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer’s lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm’s contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers’ performance with that of competitors’ drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.

TI  - Getting Return on Quality: Revenue Expansion, Cost Reduction, or Both?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Financial benefits from quality may be derived from revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both simultaneously. The literature on both market orientation and customer satisfaction provides considerable support for the effectiveness of the revenue expansion perspective, whereas the literature on both quality and operations provides equally impressive support for the effectiveness of the cost reduction perspective. There is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of attempting both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously, and some of what little empirical and theoretical literature is available suggests that emphasizing both simultaneously may not work. In a study of managers in firms seeking to obtain a financial return from quality improvements, the authors address the issue of which quality profitability emphasis (revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both) is most effective. The authors examine firm performance using managers’ reports of firm performance and longitudinal seco...

TI  - Service Orientation of a Retailer’s Business Strategy: Dimensions, Antecedents, and Performance Outcomes
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Augmenting products with services is a major way retailers have of gaining differentiation in today’s competitive market. Despite its importance, this topic has received relatively little research attention. Unlike previous research, this study adopts a more comprehensive perspective on retail services by examining three important research gaps related to a service-oriented business strategy: First, the authors elaborate on the dimensions of a service-oriented business strategy and introduce a new measure of this strategy. Second, the authors examine the antecedents of a service-oriented business strategy. In practice, there appears to be considerable variability in terms of the extent to which retailers demonstrate a service orientation, but there is a major gap in the understanding of what factors influence this orientation. Third, the authors investigate the neglected link between a service-oriented business strategy and performance outcomes. To examine these three important areas, the authors...

TI  - The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Researchers suggest that developing long-term relationships with key stakeholders is an important strategy in today’s intensely competitive business environment. Many organizations have embraced this concept, which is referred to as relationship marketing. Much of the research on relationship marketing success has examined relationships that (1) are primarily economic in nature, (2) involve business-to-business marketing, and (3) involve forprofit firms. However, the authors argue that relationship marketing is a viable strategy in such contexts as those involving high levels of social exchange, business-to-consumer marketing, and nonprofit marketing. In these contexts, relationship marketing success may require different relationship characteristics from those identified in previous research. The authors develop “the identity salience model of relationship marketing success,” which they posit is useful for explaining relationship marketing success in exchange relationships that (1) involve indiv...

TI  - Why Improving Quality Doesn't Improve Quality (or Whatever Happened to Marketing?):
PY  - 1993
AB  - Too often, quality programs fail to improve quality because they concentrate on internal processes which do not affect the customer. This is at least partially due to the alienation of marketing from the quality movement, a situation for which both sides are partially at fault. Ideally, marketing should serve as the eyes and ears of the organization, linking the external customer to managerial processes. One way to do this is to organize the collection of customer satisfaction measures around the managerial processes themselves. This forms a natural bridge from the customer to management and allows management to track the impact of quality improvements all the way from internal process measures to overall customer satisfaction and market share.

TI  - Corridors of Influence in the Dissemination of Customer-Oriented Strategy to Customer Contact Service Employees
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract It is widely held that a customer-oriented firm is more likely to deliver exceptional service quality and create satisfied customers. However, little research has addressed the question of how the orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm. This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e., formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that there are three “corridors of influence” between customer-oriented strategy and shared employee values. The dominant co...

TI  - Zero defections: quality comes to services.
PY  - 1990
AB  - Companies that want to improve their service quality should take a cue from manufacturing and focus on their own kind of scrap heap: customers who won't come back. Because that scrap heap can be every bit as costly as broken parts and misfit components, service company managers should strive to reduce it. They should aim for "zero defections"--keeping every customer they can profitably serve. As companies reduce customer defection rates, amazing things happen to their financials. Although the magnitude of the change varies by company and industry, the pattern holds: profits rise sharply. Reducing the defection rate just 5% generates 85% more profits in one bank's branch system, 50% more in an insurance brokerage, and 30% more in an auto-service chain. And when MBNA America, a Delaware-based credit card company, cut its 10% defection rate in half, profits rose a whopping 125%. But defection rates are not just a measure of service quality; they are also a guide for achieving it. By listening to the reasons why customers defect, managers learn exactly where the company is falling short and where to direct their resources. Staples, the stationery supplies retailer, uses feedback from customers to pinpoint products that are priced too high. That way, the company avoids expensive broad-brush promotions that pitch everything to everyone. Like any important change, managing for zero defections requires training and reinforcement. Great-West Life Assurance Company pays a 50% premium to group health-insurance brokers that hit customer-retention targets, and MBNA America gives bonuses to departments that hit theirs.

TI  - Consumer Perceptions of Interpersonal Equity and Satisfaction in Transactions: A Field Survey Approach
PY  - 1989
AB  - <jats:p> Automobile purchasers were surveyed about feelings toward their inputs to and outcomes from the sales transaction, as well as their perceptions of the inputs and outcomes of the salesperson. Structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimation shows two concepts advanced in the equity literature, fairness and preference (advantageous inequity), to be related differentially to input and outcome judgments. No necessary symmetry is observed between the weights attached to inputs and outcomes or between those attached to self and salesperson. When framed in a larger perspective involving satisfaction with the salesperson, the fairness dimension mediates the effect of inputs and outcomes on satisfaction whereas preference does not. The fairness influence is robust against the simultaneous inclusion of disconfirmation in the satisfaction equation. Satisfaction, in turn, is related strongly to the consumer's intention cognitions. The findings suggest that the retail sales transaction may differ in substantive ways from the subject-peer and worker-coworker comparisons in other disciplines and that models of interpersonal satisfaction in the sales transaction should include the mediating effect of the fairness dimension of equity. The managerial implications of these findings are discussed. </jats:p>

TI  - Equity and Disconfirmation Perceptions as Influences on Merchant and Product Satisfaction
PY  - 1989
AB  - Prior work on the equity and disconfirmation determinants of transaction satisfaction was extended to product satisfaction. Based on perceptions of inputs and outcomes of buyer, dealer, and salesperson, two subtractive versions of the equity formula—absolute equity difference and equity advantage—were tested with fairness and preference as mediating variables. Both variables were related only to the equity advantage formula, and disconfirmation and fairness were shown to be distinct components of post-transaction dispositions. Moreover, product satisfaction was shown to be a function of product disconfirmation, complaining, and satisfaction with the dealer. The latter apparently mediates both fairness and salesperson satisfaction.

TI  - The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer Satisfaction for Firms
PY  - 1993
AB  - This research investigates the antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction. We develop a model to link explicitly the antecedents and consequences of satisfaction in a utility-oriented framework. We estimate and test the model against alternative hypotheses from the satisfaction literature. In the process, a unique database is analyzed: a nationally representative survey of 22,300 customers of a variety of major products and services in Sweden in 1989-1990. Several well-known experimental findings of satisfaction research are tested in a field setting of national scope. For example, we find that satisfaction is best specified as a function of perceived quality and "disconfirmation"-the extent to which perceived quality fails to match prepurchase expectations. Surprisingly, expectations do not directly affect satisfaction, as is often suggested in the satisfaction literature. In addition, we find quality which falls short of expectations has a greater impact on satisfaction and repurchase intentions than quality which exceeds expectations. Moreover, we find that disconfirmation is more likely to occur when quality is easy to evaluate. Finally, in terms of systematic variation across firms, we find the elasticity of repurchase intentions with respect to satisfaction to be lower for firms that provide high satisfaction. This implies a long-run reputation effect insulating firms which consistently provide high satisfaction.

The instrument is based on a specific theory of how job design affects work motivation, and provides measures of (a) objective job dimensions, (b) individual psychological states resulting from these dimensions, (c) affective reactions of employees to the job and work setting, and (d) individual growth need strength (interpreted as the readiness of individuals to respond to "enriched" jobs). Reliability and validity data are summarized for 6S& employees on 62 different jobs in 7 organizations who have responded to a revised version of the instrument.

AB  - Abstract In this article, the authors try to determine why and under what conditions consumers enter into strong, committed, and meaningful relationships with certain companies, becoming champions of these companies and their products. Drawing on theories of social identity and organizational identification, the authors propose that strong consumer-company relationships often result from consumers’ identification with those companies, which helps them satisfy one or more important self-definitional needs. The authors elaborate on the nature of consumer-company identification, including the company identity, and articulate a consumer-level conceptual framework that offers propositions regarding the key determinants and consequences of such identification in the marketplace.

TI  - Evaluating Structural Equation Models with Unobservable Variables and Measurement Error
PY  - 1981
AB  - <jats:p> The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model. </jats:p>

PY  - 1992
AB  - Analysis confirms that patient perceptions of quality are associated with hospital financial performance. Multivariate analysis involving more than 15,000 patients discharged from 51 medical/surgical hospitals shows that discrete dimensions of hospital quality (i.e., medical and billing systems and discharge processes) explain approximately 17%-27% of the variation in financial measures such as hospital earnings, net revenue, and return on assets. The findings suggest that measurable improvements in patients' judgments of hospital quality might translate into better financial performance. The implications of these results and the limitations of the study are discussed.

TI  - Assessing the Service-Profit Chain
PY  - 2002
AB  - The service-profit chain (SPC) is a framework for linking service operations, employee assessments, and customer assessments to a firm's profitability (Heskett et al. 1994). The SPC provides an integrative framework for understanding how a firm's operational investments into service operations are related to customer perceptions and behaviors, and how these translate into profits. For a firm, it provides much needed guidance about the complex interrelationships among operational investments, customer perceptions, and the bottom line.Implementing the SPC is a pervasive problem among most service firms, and several attempts have been made to model various aspects of the SPC. However, comprehensive approaches to model the SPC are lacking, as most studies have only focused on discrete aspects of the SPC. There is a need for approaches that combine data such as measures of operational inputs, customer perceptions and behaviors, and financial outcomes from multiple sources, providing the firm with not only comprehensive diagnosis and assessment but also with implementation guidelines. Importantly, an approach that is sensitive to and can accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of such data sets is required. We outline and illustrate such an approach in this paper. Our approach has the potential to both identify and quantify the benefits of implementing a service strategy, especially for firms having multiple units (e.g., banks with branches, retail outlets, and so forth).The implementation approach is illustrated using data from a national bank in Brazil. We used customer surveys from more than 500 branches of the bank. Each individual customer's marketing survey data was linked to a number of operational metrics. First, behavioral measures of retention, such as the length of the customer's relation with the bank, the deposit amount, and number of transactions with the bank, were obtained and merged with the survey data. Second, the main branch used by each customer was identified and operational inputs (e.g., number of employees, number of available automated teller machines (ATMs)) used at that branch were obtained and merged with the data set. This data set was used to model the SPC at astrategic andoperational level.Thestrategic analysis consisted of a structural-equation model that identified the critical conceptual relationships that parsimoniously articulate the SPC for this bank. For instance, from among a variety of attribute-level perceptions, the bank was able to identify those perceptions that were critical determinants of behavioral intentions. Similarly, from a variety of available behavioral metrics, the bank was able to identify those behaviors most relevant to profitability. Theoperational analysis utilized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and provides customized feedback to each branch in implementing the strategic model. It provides each branch with a metric of its relative efficiency in translating inputs such as employees and ATMs into relevant strategic outcomes such as customer intentions and behaviors. Our illustration shows how top management can use the strategic and operational analysis in tandem. Whereas the strategic model provides the key relationships and metrics that are needed to ensure that all subunits of the firm follow a consistent strategy, the operational analysis enables each branch to benchmark its unique position so that the branch can implement the strategic model in the most efficient way. Thus,simultaneously implementing the strategic and operational model enables a firm to have a centralized focus with decentralized implementation. For this bank, the operational analysis shows that for a branch to achieve superior profitability, it is important that the branch manager not only be efficient in achieving superior satisfaction (as indicated in positive behavioral intentions) but also be efficient in translating such attitudes and intentions into relevant behaviors. In other words, superior satisfaction alone is not an unconditional guarantee of profitability.

TI  - Enough Is Enough! When Identification No Longer Prevents Negative Corporate Associations:
PY  - 2006
AB  - Negative publicity has the potential to create negative corporate associations. However, consumers’ identification with a company might moderate the extent of this effect. This article examines the impact of consumer-company identification on reactions to variable levels of negative publicity about a company. Exposing consumers who had strong identification with a company to moderately negative publicity was found to result in less negative corporate associations than for consumers who had relatively weak identification. In contrast, consumers’ levels of identification did not affect reactions to extremely negative information, resulting in equally negative corporate associations for those with strong versus weak consumer-company identification. Thus, strong identification mitigates the effects of moderately negative publicity but does not attenuate the effects of extremely negative publicity. Consumers’ perceptions of and thoughts regarding negative information about a company partially mediated the effect of identification on attitudes and behavioral intentions.

TI  - A Multistage Model of Customers' Assessments of Service Quality and Value
PY  - 1991
AB  - This article develops a model of how customers with prior experiences and expectations assess service performance levels, overall service quality, and service value. The model is applied to residential customers' assessments of local telephone service. The model is estimated with a two-stage least squares procedure through survey data. Results indicate that residential customers' assessments of quality and value are primarily a function of disconfirmation arising from discrepancies between anticipated and perceived performance levels. However, perceived performance levels also were found to have an important direct effect on quality and value assessments.

TI  - Strengthening the Satisfaction-Profit Chain
PY  - 2000
AB  - Customer satisfaction programs do not always deliver anticipated results. Disenchanted, some have labeled satisfaction measurement a “trap” and argued for abandoning customer satisfaction as a means for optimizing customer retention and profitability. The authors argue that doing so may be a mistake because the satisfaction-profit chain is conceptually solid. However, to achieve results, an important step is to recognize that the links in the satisfaction-profit chain are asymmetric and nonlinear. In this article, the authors review recent developments pertaining to the asymmetric and nonlinear nature of the links involved. They also discuss several examples based on commercial satisfaction studies where incorporating the asymmetry and nonlinearity added significant value to the firm’s understanding of the satisfaction-profit chain.

TI  - Antecedents and Consequences of Salesperson Job Satisfaction: Meta-Analysis and Assessment of Causal Effects
PY  - 1993
AB  - <jats:p> A three-phase quantitative investigation of relationships involving salesperson job satisfaction was undertaken. First, the strength, valence, and consistency of pairwise relationships were assessed by means of a meta-analysis. Second, methodological characteristics coded as moderator variables were used to account for variability in study effects. Finally, weighted mean correlations resulting from the analysis of pairwise relationships were used to evaluate a causal model of antecedents and consequences of job satisfaction. In general, relationships involving job satisfaction were robust across study contexts. Systematic moderating effects of type of sales-force and operationalization of job satisfaction were found. Several summary conclusions about antecedents and consequences of salesperson job satisfaction are drawn from the analyses. </jats:p>

Analyses revealed statistically significant and stable relationships across various time lags for 3 of 7 scales. Overall Job Satisfaction and Satisfaction With Security were predicted by ROA and EPS more strongly than the reverse (although some of the reverse relationships were also significant); Satisfaction With Pay suggested a more reciprocal relationship with ROA and EPS.

AB  - This study investigates the internal dimensions of the Organizational Identification Questionnaire (OIQ). Results of factorial analytic tests of cross-sectional and longitudinal data indicate that the OIQ is unidimensional across organizations and time, but that only 12 of 25 items contribute meaningfully to the scale. Furthermore, these 12 items essentially constitute an affective measure of organizational commitment, not organizational identification as theorized. A discussion of these results examines the implications of these findings toward the future use of the OIQ scale.

TI  - Alumni and their alma mater: A partial test of the reformulated model of organizational identification
PY  - 1992
AB  - Summary Organizational identification is defined as a perceived oneness with an organization and the experience of the organization's successes and failures as one's own. While identification is considered important to the organization, it has not been clearly operationalized. The current study tests a proposed model of organizational identification. Self-report data from 297 alumni of an all-male religious college indicate that identification with the alma mater was associated with: (1) the hypothesized organizational antecedents of organizational distinctiveness, organizational prestige, and (absence of) intraorganizational competition, but not with interorganizational competition, (2) the hypothesized individual antecedents of satisfaction with the organization, tenure as students, and sentimentality, but not with recency of attendance, number of schools attended, or the existence of a mentor, and (3) the hypothesized outcomes of making financial contributions, willingness to advise one's offspring and others to attend the college, and participating in various school functions. The findings provide direction for academic administrators seeking to increase alumni support, as well as for corporate managers concerned about the loyalty of workers in an era of mergers and takeovers.

PY  - 2002
AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the true correlation between attitudinal organizational commitment and job performance and to identify moderators of this correlation. One-hundred and eleven samples from 93 published studies were included. The corrected mean correlation was 0.20. The correlation was at least marginally significantly stronger for: (a) extra-role performance as opposed to in-role performance; (b) white-collar workers as opposed to blue-collar workers; and (c) performance assessed by self ratings as opposed to supervisor ratings or objective indicators. Four other assumed moderators (commitment measure: Affective Commitment Scale versus Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, job level, age, and tenure) did not have at least marginally significant effects.

AB  - Abstract : Survey data from 142 employees and 968 customers from 28 branches of a bank were analyzed with the following results: (1) Moderate support was found for previous work on correlates of role stress for boundary role employees and good support was found for relationships between branch employees' and branch customers' service perceptions and attitudes; (2) Some significant relationships were reported between branch employees' perceptions of organizational human resources practices and branch customers' attitudes about service; and (3) employee attitudes and customer attitudes were related to their own and one another's turnover intentions. Results were discussed from the perspective of promoting an integration of consumer and organizational behavior in the service sector.

TI  - On the evaluation of structural equation models
PY  - 1988
AB  - Criteria for evaluating structural equation models with latent variables are defined, critiqued, and illustrated. An overall program for model evaluation is proposed based upon an interpretation of converging and diverging evidence. Model assessment is considered to be a complex process mixing statistical criteria with philosophical, historical, and theoretical elements. Inevitably the process entails some attempt at a reconcilation between so-called objective and subjective norms.

TI  - Organizational identification: A conceptual and operational review.
PY  - 2005
AB  - There is a growing body of literature presenting the argument that processes of organizational identification (OI) are extremely important in helping to ensure that staff work towards the interests of the organization. There are, however, a number of problems with the way that the notion of OI has been conceptualized and operationalized in the extant literature. This paper examines how OI has been defined and measured over a number of decades. A number of problems are identified with how OI has been conceptualized by researchers, including, for example, issues about whether there is an affective element to identification and how the construct relates to organizational commitment. The paper also includes a review of previous approaches to measuring the concept of OI and raises some key problems with existing research tools. The paper concludes by arguing for a particular conceptualization of OI which helps to clarify the complex relationship between identification and organizational commitment, while at the same time accommodating previous definitions of the construct.

PY  - 1998
AB  - <jats:p> The authors develop a conceptual framework of the marketing–finance interface and discuss its implications for the theory and practice of marketing. The framework proposes that marketing is concerned with the task of developing and managing market-based assets, or assets that arise from the commingling of the firm with entities in its external environment. Examples of market-based assets include customer relationships, channel relationships, and partner relationships. Market-based assets, in turn, increase shareholder value by accelerating and enhancing cash flows, lowering the volatility and vulnerability of cash flows, and increasing the residual value of cash flows. </jats:p>

TI  - Market Orientation: Antecedents and Consequences
PY  - 1993
AB  - <jats:p> This research addresses three questions: (1) Why are some organizations more market-oriented than others? (2) What effect does a market orientation have on employees and business performance? (3) Does the linkage between a market orientation and business performance depend on the environmental context? The findings from two national samples suggest that a market orientation is related to top management emphasis on the orientation, risk aversion of top managers, interdepartmental conflict and connectedness, centralization, and reward system orientation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that a market orientation is related to overall (judgmental) business performance (but not market share), employees’ organizational commitment, and esprit de corps. Finally, the linkage between a market orientation and performance appears to be robust across environmental contexts that are characterized by varying degrees of market turbulence, competitive intensity, and technological turbulence. </jats:p>

TI  - The Selling Orientation-Customer Orientation (S.O.C.O.) Scale: A Proposed Short Form
PY  - 2010
AB  - This article reports the results of an examination of the Selling Orientation-Customer Orientation scale to determine if the number of items could be reduced while still maintaining the scale's dimensionality and consistency. Analysis of a new Australian data set was undertaken using data from 250 salespeople, 157 of their managers and 276 of their customers in a range of business to business markets. The findings provide evidence that salespeople's customer orientation, as defined by Saxe and Weitz (1982), can be measured with little information loss by ten items, rather than the twenty-four items originally suggested. This significant reduction in length may contribute to a more reliable and valid scale by reducing response fatigue and acquiescence bias, as well as making it possible to include the construct in larger studies with other multiple item scales. Further research is suggested to test the revised scale across a number of industries and consumer groups, to verify its generalizability.

TI  - Customer Satisfaction, Market Share, and Profitability: Findings from Sweden
PY  - 1994
AB  - <jats:p> Are there economic benefits to improving customer satisfaction? Many firms that are frustrated in their efforts to improve quality and customer satisfaction are beginning to question the link between customer satisfaction and economic returns. The authors investigate the nature and strength of this link. They discuss how expectations, quality, and price should affect customer satisfaction and why customer satisfaction, in turn, should affect profitability; this results in a set of hypotheses that are tested using a national customer satisfaction index and traditional accounting measures of economic returns, such as return on investment. The findings support a positive impact of quality on customer satisfaction, and, in turn, profitability. The authors demonstrate the economic benefits of increasing customer satisfaction using both an empirical forecast and a new analytical model. In addition, they discuss why increasing market share actually might lead to lower customer satisfaction and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis. Finally, two new findings emerge: First, the market's expectations of the quality of a firm's output positively affects customers’ overall satisfaction with the firm; and second, these expectations are largely rational, albeit with a small adaptive component. </jats:p>

TI  - A National Customer Satisfaction Barometer: The Swedish Experience
PY  - 1992
AB  - <jats:p> Many individual companies and some industries monitor customer satisfaction on a continual basis, but Sweden is the first country to do so on a national level. The annual Customer Satisfaction Barometer (CSB) measures customer satisfaction in more than 30 industries and for more than 100 corporations. The new index is intended to be complementary to productivity measures. Whereas productivity basically reflects quantity of output, CSB measures quality of output (as experienced by the buyer). The author reports the results of a large-scale Swedish effort to measure quality of the total consumption process as customer satisfaction. The significance of customer satisfaction and its place within the overall strategy of the firm are discussed. An implication from examining the relationship between market share and customer satisfaction by a location model is that satisfaction should be lower in industries where supply is homogeneous and demand heterogeneous. Satisfaction should be higher when the heterogeneity/homogeneity of demand is matched by the supply. Empirical support is found for that proposition in monopolies as well as in competitive market structures. Likewise, industries in general are found to have a high level of customer satisfaction if they are highly dependent on satisfaction for repeat business. The opposite is found for industries in which companies have more captive markets. For Sweden, the 1991 results show a slight increase in CSB, which should have a positive effect on the general economic climate. </jats:p>

PY  - 1996
AB  - <jats:p> If service quality relates to retention of customers at the aggregate level, as other research has indicated, then evidence of its impact on customers’ behavioral responses should be detectable. The authors offer a conceptual model of the impact of service quality on particular behaviors that signal whether customers remain with or defect from a company. Results from a multicompany empirical study examining relationships from the model concerning customers’ behavioral intentions show strong evidence of their being influenced by service quality. The findings also reveal differences in the nature of the quality-intentions link across different dimensions of behavioral intentions. The authors’ discussion centers on ways the results and research approach of their study can be helpful to researchers and managers. </jats:p>

TI  - SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING IN THE GLOBAL MARKET: THE PERFORMANCE OF US AND EUROPEAN FUNDS
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper investigates the style and performance of US and European global socially responsible funds. Several specifications of the return-generating process are applied as well as their corresponding conditional versions.



Most European global socially responsible funds do not show significant performance differences in relation to both conventional and socially responsible benchmarks. US funds and Austrian funds show evidence of underperformance. By applying conditional models, we find evidence of time-varying betas but not of time-varying alphas. With respect to investment style, we find evidence that socially responsible funds are strongly exposed to small cap and growth stocks. Although these results are consistent with previous studies, they uncover some misclassification issues in these funds. Finally, we also document a significant home bias for global socially responsible funds. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Investor Diversification and International Equity Markets
PY  - 1991
AB  - Since the fortunes of different nations do not always move together, investors can diversify their portfolios by holding assets in several countries. The benefits of international diversification have been recognized for decades. In spite of this, most investors hold nearly all of their wealth in domestic assets. In this paper we use a simple model of investor preferences and behavior to show that current portfolio patterns imply that investors in each nation expect returns in their domestic equity market to be several hundred basis points higher than returns in other markets. The lack of diversification appears to be result of investor choices, rather than institutional constraints.

TI  - Trust, Social Capital and Economic Development ∗
PY  - 2005
AB  - Many argue that elements of a society’s norms, culture or social capital are central to understanding its development. However, these notions have been difficult to capture in economic models. Here we explore ap ossible role for ‘trustworthiness’ as corresponding to social capital. Individuals are trustworthy when they perform in accordance with promises, even if this does not maximize their payoffs. The usual focus on incentive structures in motivating behaviour plays no role here. Instead, we emphasize more deep-seated modes of behaviour and consider trustworthy agents being socialized to act as they do. To model this socialization, we borrow from a process of preference evolution pioneered by Bisin and Verdier (2001). The model developed endogenously accounts for social capital and explores its role in the process of economic development. It captures in a simple, formal way the interaction between social capital and the economy’s productive processes. The results obtained caution against rapid reform and provide an explanation for why late developing countries may not easily be able to transplant the modes of production that have proved useful in the West.

AB  - It was postulated that shared values determine social trust in institutions and persons related to a technology: One has trust in people holding similar salient values. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that social trust has a positive influence on perceived benefits and a negative impact on perceived risks. Results of a survey of University of Zurich students indicated that the proposed causal model explained perception of pesticides, nuclear power, and artificial sweetener very well. When social trust was controlled, the relation between risks and benefits perceived diminished. Results indicate that social trust is a key predictive factor of the perceived risks and benefits of a technology, and provide support for the salient values similarity theory of social trust.

TI  - Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity
PY  - 1995
AB  - In his bestselling "The End of History and the Last Man", Francis Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War would also mean the beginning of a struggle for position in the rapidly emerging order of 21st-century capitalism. In "Trust", a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order "after History", he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance. Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy. A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, "Trust" is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.

Consequently, this perceived market failure in public SEE disclosure has been supplemented by the development of sophisticated private SEE disclosure channels.

TI  - Culture, Cosmopolitanism, and Risk Management
PY  - 1997
AB  - Most cultural approaches to risk management deal with the connections between the forms of social relations within groups and the risk concerns of those groups. According to these theories, a certain limited set of different relational forms (usually three, four, or five) lead to specific, different and conflicting, risk concerns. In contrast to these theories, cosmopolitanism is an approach to culture that focuses, not on forms of sociality, but on changes among forms—expansions and contractions in the inclusivity of forms and movement by persons from one form of sociality to another. Relative to other cultural theories, cosmopolitanism thus is much more concerned with the solution of risk management problems than with their origins. Cosmopolitanism can be thought of as a cultural continuum, with cosmopolitanism at one end and pluralism at the other. Cosmopolitan persons are more open to cultural change—and thus the solution of risk management problems. In this article, we outline our new theory of cosmopolitanism, describe a method for measuring it and present an experimental study that tests some implications of the theory. Results from the study support the theory by showing that, compared to pluralistic respondents, cosmopolitan respondents are more inclusive in their risk management judgments—that is, they express equal concern for a local and a national issue, whereas the pluralistic respondents express greater concern in the local case. We discuss the risk management implications of a cosmopolitan approach to culture.

TI  - Trust in Large Organizations
PY  - 1996
AB  - Several authors suggest that trust is an important determinant of cooperation between strangers in a society, and therefore of performance of social institutions. We argue that trust should be particularly important for the performance of large organizations. In a cross-section of countries, evidence on government performance, participation in civic and professional societies, importance of large firms, and the performance of social institutions more generally supports this hypothesis. Moreover, trust is lower in countries with dominant hierarchical religions, which may have deterred networks of cooperation trust hold up remarkably well on a cross-section of countries.

TI  - Shared values, social trust, and the perception of geographic cancer clusters.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Extensive scientific investigations often fail to identify specific carcinogens that have caused geographic clusters of cancer cases. In many such examples, public health officials and other experts have concluded that the cluster is not the result of a particular local environmental condition. Despite this conclusion by experts, concerned members of local communities often persist in believing that the cancer cluster was not random. The present study accounts for the persistence of this belief on the basis of two factors: (a) the tendency of the human mind to identify patterns (and causes), rather than randomness; and (b) a lack of social trust in public health experts. It was expected that perceived shared values evoke social trust. Individuals who conclude that public health experts share their values should be more likely to accept the experts' conclusion that a cancer cluster reflects randomness, not a particular local cause. Individuals who trust authorities should be more inclined than individuals not having trust to accept that a geographic cluster of cancer cases is a coincidence. Data from Swiss students (N = 334) supported these expectations. Additionally, significant gender differences were observed. Females had less trust in authorities and perceived the cancer cluster as less likely to be a result of pure chance than did males. Practical implications of the results are discussed.

TI  - Does Social Capital Have an Economic Payoff? A Cross-Country Investigation
PY  - 1997
AB  - This paper presents evidence that "social capital" matters for measurable economic performance, using indicators of trust and civic norms from the World Values Surveys for a sample of 29 market economies. Memberships in formal groups—Putnam's measure of social capital—is not associated with trust or with improved economic performance. We find trust and civic norms are stronger in nations with higher and more equal incomes, with institutions that restrain predatory actions of chief executives, and with better-educated and ethnically homogeneous populations.

TI  - Consumer Confidence and Stock Returns
PY  - 2003
AB  - Consumer confidence predicts economic activity, but does it also predict stock returns? Do stock returns affect consumer confidence? And what is the relationship between consumer confidence and investor sentiment? Answers to these questions are gained through examination of the consumer confidence measures of the University of Michigan and the Conference Board. Consumer confidence rises with high stock returns, but high consumer confidence is followed by low stock returns. Sentiments of individual investors about the stock market improve with consumer confidence about the economy, as if individuals were unaware that stock prices are a leading indicator of the economy. No relationship is found between changes in the sentiments of institutional investors and consumer confidence, however.

TI  - Beyond Happy Families: A Critical Reevaluation of the Control-Resistance-Identity Triangle
PY  - 1999
AB  - In this article, the author explores the nature of contemporary organizational controls, the extent to which they can be said to colonize employee subjectivity, and the types of resistance which they generate. Labor process, psychoanalytic, critical theory, and Foucauldian perspectives are juxtaposed and a number of similarities and divergences are noted. It is argued that many of these perspectives prematurely lament the end of employee recalcitrance and exaggerate the magnitude and totality of organizational controls, generating over-managed and overcontrolled images of individuals, organizations, and societies. It is proposed that a rapprochement of psychoanalytic and labor theory approaches can lead to an appreciation of unmanaged and unmanageable terrains in organizations, in which human agency may be rediscovered, neither as a class-conscious proletariat nor as a transcendental subject, but as a struggling, feeling, thinking, suffering subject, one capable of obeying and disobeying, controlling and ...

TI  - Mutual Fund Attributes and Investor Behavior
PY  - 2007
AB  - I study the dynamics of investor cash flows in socially responsible mutual funds. Consistent with anecdotal evidence of loyalty, the monthly volatility of investor cash flows is lower in socially responsible funds than in conventional funds. I find strong evidence that cash flows into socially responsible funds are more sensitive to lagged positive returns than cash flows into conventional funds, and weaker evidence that cash outflows from socially responsible funds are less sensitive to lagged negative returns. These results indicate that investors derive utility from the socially responsible attribute, especially when returns are positive.

TI  - Test of a trust and confidence model in the applied context of electromagnetic field (EMF) risks.
PY  - 2003
AB  - Trust is an important factor in risk management. There is little agreement among researchers, however, on how trust in risk management should be studied. Based on a comprehensive review of the trust literature a "dual-mode model of social trust and confidence" is proposed. Trust and confidence are separate but, under some circumstances, interacting sources of cooperation. Trust is based on value similarity, and confidence is based on performance. According to our model, judging similarity between an observer's currently active values and the values attributed to others determines social trust. Thus, the basis for trust is a judgment that the person to be trusted would act as the trusting person would. Interpretation of the other's performance influences confidence. Both social trust and confidence have an impact on people's willingness to cooperate (e.g., accept electromagnetic fields or EMF in the neighborhood). The postulated model was tested in the applied context of EMF risks. Structural equation modeling procedures and data from a random sample of 1,313 Swiss citizens between 18 and 74 years old were used. Results indicated that after minor modifications the model explained the data very well. In the applied context of EMF risks, both trust and confidence had an impact on cooperation. Results suggest that the dual-mode model of social trust and confidence could be used as a common framework in the field of trust and risk management. Practical implications of the results are discussed.

TI  - Consumer sentiment and the stock market
PY  - 1999
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between movements in consumer sentiment and stock prices. At the aggregate level, the two share a strong contemporaneous relationship: an increase in equity values boosts sentiment. However, I examined the nature of the relationship between the two. Does an increase in stock prices raise aggregate sentiment because people are wealthier or because they use movements in stock prices as an indicator of future economic activity and potential labor income growth? Using individual observations from the Michigan survey I found results more consistent with the view that people use movements in equity prices as a leading indicator. Although the findings do not rule out a traditional wealth effect, they do raise some questions about the causal role of wealth in aggregate spending.

TI  - The Investment Performance of UK “Ethical” Unit Trusts
PY  - 1992
AB  - Examines the impact on investment returns of stated non‐financial criteria by utilizing information on UK “ethical” unit trusts. Over a limited period of observation there was weak evidence of some overperformance on a risk‐adjusted basis by “ethical” unit trusts. Suggests arguments that might intuitively explain overperformance or underperformance. There is clear evidence that the “ethical” trusts have UK investment portfolios more skewed towards companies with low market capitalization than the market as a whole. Associated with this, they tend to be invested in low dividend yield companies. The degree of international diversification varies and a suitable international benchmark may be needed to separate out any “ethical” effect.

TI  - Structuring cooperative relationships between organizations
PY  - 1992
AB  - Alliances and similar cooperative efforts are receiving increased attention in the strategic management literature. These relationships differ in significant ways from those governed by markets or hierarchies, and pose very different issues for researchers and managers. In this paper we address alternative forms of governance in cases where multiple organizations repeatedly cooperate. We explore their characteristics and follow this with a discussion of criteria which we believe bear on the choice of governance: risk and reliance on trust. We offer propositions on relationships between these criteria and the choice of governance mechanisms. In the concluding section of the paper we explore the implications of our analysis for managers and scholars.

TI  - Morals and Markets: The Case of Ethical Investing
PY  - 1999
AB  - This paper is a report of an empirical psychological study of the relationship between the ethical and financial beliefs and desires of ethical investors. Semi-structured interviews of 20 ethical investors have been carried out by the project 10 of which have been analysed using qualitative data analysis software. All of our participants faced the problem that, while they had ethical concerns, they were not prepared to sacrifice their essential financial requirements to address them. We found four common ways of dealing with this problem: they divided up their money into core and surplus accounts; they decided that it was enough to only be a partial ethical investor; they avoided detailed consideration of the costs of ethical investment; and they avoided rigorous ethical thinking. One equilibrium position arising from these responses is a portfolio approach to ethics, which allows people to assuage their consciences by investing only a small proportion of their investments ethically, while leaving the rest in non-ethical investment vehicles.

TI  - It’s a Matter of Principle: The Role of Personal Values in Investment Decisions
PY  - 2009
AB  - We investigate the role of personal values in an investment decision in a controlled experimental setting. Participants were asked to choose an investment in a bond issued by a tobacco company or a bond issued by a non-tobacco company that offered an equal or sometimes lower yield. We then surveyed the participants regarding their feelings toward tobacco use to determine whether these values influenced their investment decision. Using factor analysis, we identified investment- and tobacco-related dimensions on which participants’ responses tended to load. Two of these factors, relating to the societal impact of investment decisions and the health effects of tobacco, were highly significant in determining whether participants selected a tobacco or non-tobacco related investment. More importantly, we found that when the rate of return on a tobacco-related investment exceeds the rate of return on an investment not involving tobacco by 1%, the intensity of participant concerns about the societal effects of their investment decisions was especially important in determining investment choices. This finding indicates that traditional wealth-maximization approaches, which do not consider the personal values of the investor, omit an important factor that affects investment decisions.

TI  - Exploring the Dimensionality of Trust in Risk Regulation
PY  - 2003
AB  - This article investigates possible differential levels of trust in government regulation across five different risk contexts and the relationship between a number of concepts that might be thought of as comprising distinctive “dimensions” of trust. It appeared that how people perceive government and its policies toward risk regulation was surprisingly similar for each of the five risk cases. A principal-component analysis showed that the various trust items could best be described by two dimensions: a general trust dimension, which was concerned with a wide range of trust-relevant aspects, such as competence, care, fairness, and openness, and a scepticism component that reflects a sceptical view regarding how risk policies are brought about and enacted. Again, the results were surprisingly similar across the five risk cases, as the same solution was found in each of the different samples. It was also examined whether value similarity has an additional value in predicting trust in risk regulation, compared to the more conventional aspects of trust. Based on the two independent trust factors that were found in this study, a typology of trust is proposed that ranges from full trust to a deep type of distrust. It is argued that for a functioning society it could well be more suitable to have critical but involved citizens in many situations.

TI  - Performance and Performance Persistence of ‘Ethical’ Unit Trusts in the UK
PY  - 2007
AB  - :  We examine performance, and persistence in the performance, of UK ‘ethical’ or SRI funds and find that performance appears to be time-varying, showing that conclusions on performance itself are influenced by whether a static or time varying model is employed. Given evidence that many UK funds which claim to be international in nature may exhibit home bias in their portfolio allocations, we also propose a new measure for performance of international funds that allows for this and show that such recognition has important implications for the conclusions drawn with respect to these funds. We find evidence that supports persistence in performance, particularly at longer time horizons. There is some evidence that for domestic funds, past ‘winning’ SRI funds outperform ‘losing’ SRI funds to a greater extent than their control portfolio counterparts.

TI  - ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES TO CRISIS: THE CENTRALITY OF TRUST
PY  - 1996
AB  - Within this division, there is a real problem with the lower level people not trusting the people at the top, because the people feel that the management doesn't tell them the truth, doesn't level with them, isn't honest, has a hidden agenda, plays games. I could go on and on. I think it's worse today than I have ever seen it in my 33-year career in this company. --Automotive executive In the latter part of the twentieth century, organizational crises have become almost routine. Indeed, crises are occurring on a scale not previously encountered, most of them human-caused, either through faulty decisions (Janis, 1989), technological complexities (Perrow, 1984) or both (Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992). The purpose of this paper is to develop a midrange theory that explains why organizations respond differently during crisis, and how organizational performance may increase rather than decrease during crisis.

TI  - The Economic Virtues of SRI and CSR
PY  - 2007
AB  - textabstractFinancial markets and company managers are increasingly acknowledging the concepts of socially responsible investing (SRI) and corporate social responsibility (CSR), but not without reservations. These hesitations are largely attributable to ongoing debates about a potential conflict between social responsibility goals and the traditional financial objectives of investors and companies. This thesis bundles six empirical studies that deepen our understanding of the economic value of SRI and CSR. Several empirical questions underlie these studies, such as: do CSR practices improve a firm’s profitability? Do financial markets value corporate social responsibility? Do SRI criteria constrain investment portfolio optimization, or do they help investors in their hunt for underpriced securities? This thesis shows that SRI and CSR can be studied in new ways to answer these questions. We examine unique SRI stock portfolios with superior return/risk profiles, and provide a fresh look at strategies for investors in SRI mutual funds. By analyzing a wide range of pathways that lead CSR to interrelated measures of corporate financial performance, we further explain whether CSR carries value-relevant information. Taken together, the six studies discuss the channels of transmission from CSR to operating performance, the cost of capital, firm value, analysts’ earnings expectations, and stock return. The conclusions from this dissertation are that (i) integrating SRI criteria into portfolio construction does not negatively affect investment performance; (ii) investors can use information on firms’ eco-efficiency to make investment decisions that improve the return/risk profile of their portfolios; (iii) common CSR attributes, such as corporate environmental responsibility, and human capital management, have a significant association with traditional measures of corporate performance. We recommend making CSR salient to investors in the form of extra-financial information, with an emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance themes.

TI  - The performance of socially responsible mutual funds: incorporating sociopolitical information in portfolio selection
PY  - 1999
AB  - Outlines increased interest from investors in corporate social policies over the last ten years and previous research comparing the investment performance of “socially responsible” (SR) portfolios with others. Measures performance for a US sample of SR and conventional mutual funds using a variety of methods (including Jensen’s Alpha, the Sharpe Ratio and the Treynor ratio), analysing the funds by investment strategy, size, systematic risk and the use of inclusion screens. Presents the results, which do not give a clear advantage to either group, but show that funds with inclusion screens consistently outperform those without. Calls for further research on the relationship between corporate social performance and portfolio performance and comparisons between SR and conventional funds.

TI  - What Matters to Individual Investors? Evidence from the Horse's Mouth
PY  - 2020
AB  - We survey a representative sample of U.S. individuals about how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and decisions. We find substantial support for many factors hypothesized to affect portfolio equity share, particularly background risk, investment horizon, rare disasters, transactional factors, and fixed costs of stock market participation. Individuals tend to believe that past mutual fund performance is a good signal of stock-picking skill, actively managed funds do not suffer from diseconomies of scale, value stocks are safer and do not have higher expected returns, and high-momentum stocks are riskier and do have higher expected returns.

TI  - Socially responsible investors and the disposition effect
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract In this paper we analyze the possible interaction between socially responsible investment and the disposition effect—the tendency to hold losing stocks too long and sell winning stocks too early. We analyze trading and portfolio data from a large retail bank and find that socially responsible investors display a greater disposition effect than conventional investors. Only when investors invest a substantial proportion of their portfolio in socially responsible stocks do we find evidence for a differential disposition effect, whereas we do not find evidence for a relationship between the percentage invested in socially responsible stocks and the disposition effect.

TI  - Individual Risk Attitudes: Measurement, Determinants and Behavioral Consequences
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper studies risk attitudes using a large representative survey and a complementary experiment conducted with a representative subject pool in subjects’ homes. Using a question asking people about their willingness to take risks \"in general\", we find that gender, age, height, and parental background have an economically significant impact on willingness to take risks. The experiment confirms the behavioral validity of this measure, using paid lottery choices. Turning to other questions about risk attitudes in specific contexts, we find similar results on the determinants of risk attitudes, and also shed light on the deeper question of stability of risk attitudes across contexts. We conduct a horse race of the ability of different measures to explain risky behaviors such as holdings stocks, occupational choice, and smoking. The question about risk taking in general generates the best all-round predictor of risky behavior.

TI  - Corporate Social Responsibility: An Economic and Financial Framework
PY  - 2005
AB  - I analyze corporate social responsibility (CSR) from economic and financial perspectives, and suggest how it is reflected in financial markets. CSR is defined as a programme of actions to reduce externalized costs or to avoid distributional conflicts. It has evolved in response to market failures, a Coasian solution to problems associated with social costs. The analysis suggests that there is a resource-allocation role for CSR programmes in cases of market failure through private–social cost differentials, and also where distributional disagreements are strong. In some sectors of the economy private and social costs are roughly in line and distributional debates are unusual: here CSR has little role to play. Such sectors are outnumbered by those where CSR can play a valuable role in ensuring that the invisible hand acts, as intended, to produce the social good. It can also act to improve corporate profits and guard against reputational risks.

TI  - The investor that could and would: The effect of proactive personality on sustainable investment choice
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract This paper investigates the influence of exposure to environmental images and proactive personality on investor preferences for sustainable investment. Building on Barbara Fredrickson’s broaden and build theory of positive emotions, we investigated how exposure to images of nature in a healthy (positive) versus damaged (negative) state interacts with the proactive personality trait in influencing an investor’s willingness to forego financial return to invest in a sustainable investment option. The results of our experiment indicate that to stimulate sustainable investment, investors should be exposed to positive environmental pictures and that this effect is stronger for highly proactive individuals. These results suggest that proactive individuals in particular view sustainable investing as a way to promote environmental preservation. Our results hold even after controlling for wealth effects.

TI  - Representative Trust and Reciprocity: Prevalence and Determinants
PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper provides evidence about the determinants of trust and reciprocal inclinations, that is, a tendency for people to respond in kind to hostile or kind actions, in a representative setting. We investigate the prevalence of reciprocity in the population, the correlation between trust and positive and negative reciprocal inclinations within person, the individual determinants of reciprocity, and the relationship with psychological measures of personality. We find that most people state reciprocal inclinations, in particular in terms of positive reciprocity, as well as substantial heterogeneity in the degree of trust and reciprocity. Trust and positive reciprocity are only weakly correlated, while trust and negative reciprocity exhibit a negative correlation. In terms of determinants, being female and increasing age are associated with stronger positive and weaker negative reciprocal tendencies. Taller people are more positively reciprocal, but height has no impact on negative reciprocity. Psychological traits also affect trust and reciprocity. (JEL D63, J3, J6)

TI  - Profiling German-speaking socially responsible investors
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze the main motives of investors in allocating their money in a socially responsible (SR) way. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on primary data collected in a survey using an online questionnaire. This paper applies tests for continuous and categorical data and (ordered) logit models. Findings – In a multivariate analysis that investigates determinants of SR investing, this study finds little influence of the demographic factors of gender and investment volume and none of educational level. Furthermore, it shows that the regions investors allocate their money to are significant along with the preference toward the order of return, risk and liquidity. Moreover, there appears to be a gap between supply and demand of SR investments. Additionally, there are indications that a very important inducement for SR investing is the expectation of a high financial performance. Originality/value – There are very few international studies concerning the lin...

We discuss two channels through which financial literacy might facilitate wealth accumulation. First, financial knowledge increases the likelihood of investing in the stock market, allowing individuals to benefit from the equity premium. Second, financial literacy is positively related to retirement planning and the development of a savings plan has been shown to boost wealth.

TI  - Which proportion of SR investments is enough? A survey-based approach
PY  - 2016
AB  - This article examines the determinants of the optimal percentage that private investors seek to invest in a socially responsible (SR) way when forming their portfolio. By conducting a global online survey in English, German and French, we find indications that it is sufficient for the majority of investors to have a certain amount of their budget invested sustainably. Accordingly, the optimal proportion tends to be lower the higher the available investment volume is. In addition, the non-financial utility derived from SR investments appears to be independent of the form of financing the investor provides. Moreover, the results show that well-educated women and slightly younger persons seek to invest a higher percentage of their portfolio socially responsibly.

TI  - New Trends in Measuring Environmental Attitudes: Measuring Endorsement of the New Ecological Paradigm: A Revised NEP Scale
PY  - 2000
AB  - Dunlap and Van Liere's New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale, published in 1978, has become a widely used measure of proenvironmental orientation. This article develops a revised NEP Scale designed to improve upon the original one in several respects: (1) It taps a wider range of facets of an ecological worldview, (2) It offers a balanced set of pro- and anti-NEP items, and (3) It avoids outmoded terminology. The new scale, termed the New Ecological Paradigm Scale, consists of 15 items. Results of a 1990 Washington State survey suggest that the items can be treated as an internally consistent summated ratingscale and also indicate a modest growth in pro-NEP responses among Washington residents over the 14 years since the original study.

TI  - On the Economics and Biology of Trust
PY  - 2009
AB  - In recent years, many social scientists have claimed that trust plays an important role in economic and social transactions. Despite its proposed importance, the measurement and the definition of trust seem to be not fully settled, and the identification of the exact role of trust in economic interactions has proven to be elusive. It is still not clear whether trust is just an epiphenomenon of good institutions or whether it plays an independent causal role capable of shaping important aggregate economic outcomes. In this paper, I rely on a behavioral definition of trust that enables us to relate it to economic primitives such as preferences and beliefs. I review strong biological and behavioral evidence indicating that trusting is not just a special case of risk-taking, but based on important forms of social preferences such as betrayal aversion. Behaviorally defined trust also opens the door for understanding national and ethnic trust differences in terms of differences in preferences and beliefs, and it suggests ways to examine and interpret a causal role of trust.

TI  - Portfolio Choice and Health Status
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes the role health status plays in household portfolio decisions using data from the Health and Retirement Study. The results indicate that health is a significant predictor of both the probability of owning different types of financial assets and the share of financial wealth held in each asset category. Households in poor health are less likely to hold risky financial assets, other things (including the level of total wealth) being the same. Poor health is associated with a smaller share of financial wealth held in risky assets and a larger share in safe assets. We find no evidence that the relationship between health status and portfolio allocation is driven by “third variables” that simultaneously affect health and financial decisions. Further, the relationship between health status and portfolio choice does not appear to operate through the effect of poor health on individuals’ attitudes toward risk, their planning horizons, or their health insurance status.

PY  - 2018
AB  - On the basis of unique data from an (online) representative web-based survey among financial decision-makers in Germany, this paper empirically examines the relevance of contextual factors including social norms for socially responsible investments (SRIs). The econometric analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between SRIs and common attitudinal variables such as feelings of warm glow or social norms as, for example, prevalent in an environmental organization. In contrast, a left-wing political orientation is significantly negatively correlated with SRIs. However, the main result is that also perceived behaviours and expectations of peers for SRIs, especially in the narrowest social environment like the family, friends, and colleagues, are highly relevant. Overall, this suggests that SRI investors gain strong non-financial utility from sustainable investments.

TI  - ESG and financial performance: aggregated evidence from more than 2000 empirical studies
PY  - 2015
AB  - The search for a relation between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and corporate financial performance (CFP) can be traced back to the beginning of the 1970s. Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More impor...

PY  - 2004
AB  - We propose that stock-market participation is influenced by social interaction. In our model, any given “social” investor finds the market more attractive when more of his peers participate. We test this theory using data from the Health and Retirement Study, and find that social households—those who interact with their neighbors, or attend church—are substantially more likely to invest in the market than non-social households, controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk tolerance. Moreover, consistent with a peer-effects story, the impact of sociability is stronger in states where stock-market participation rates are higher.

TI  - Drivers of renewable technology adoption in the household sector
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we undertake a simultaneous assessment of the importance of factors that are individually found to be significant for the adoption of renewable energy systems by households but are not yet tested jointly. These are sociodemographic and housing characteristics, environmental concern, personality traits, and economic factors; i.e. the expected costs of and revenues from the investment. Our results suggest that household decisions to invest in photovoltaic systems and solar thermal facilities are mainly driven by economic factors. Taking account of sociodemographic and housing characteristics, environmental concern, or personality traits has comparatively little relevance, while the quantitative nexus between the decision to invest and returns on the investment is robust to their inclusion.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The study of household finance is challenging because household behavior is difficult to measure, and households face constraints not captured by textbook models. Evidence on participation, diversification, and mortgage refinancing suggests that many households invest effectively, but a minority make significant mistakes. This minority appears to be poorer and less well educated than the majority of more successful investors. There is some evidence that households understand their own limitations and avoid financial strategies for which they feel unqualified. Some financial products involve a cross‐subsidy from naive to sophisticated households, and this can inhibit welfare‐improving financial innovation.</jats:p>

TI  - Motives to engage in sustainable investment: a comparison between institutional and private investors
PY  - 2011
AB  - The current study compares motives to invest in accordance with socially responsible criteria among different groups of investors. In total, 60 employees from 19 investment institutions, 453 private investors and 71 institutional investors participated in a questionnaire study. While socially responsible investment (SRI) among private and institutional investors was guided by self-transcendent values (environmental and social values), this was not the case among fund managers working in investment institutions. Fund managers in investment institutions were affected by beliefs about long-term returns of SRI. Private investors were, in addition, influenced by beliefs about long-term returns, whereas institutional investors were motivated by an effort to reduce financial risks. Finally, investment institutions tended to overrate the importance of financial returns among their beneficiaries (private and institutional beneficiaries) and underestimate the importance of ethical, environmental and social aspects for beneficiaries. The results indicate that private and institutional investors/beneficiaries give a wider interpretation of fiduciary duty than investment institutions do.

TI  - The Intergenerational Transmission of Risk and Trust Attitudes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Recent theories endogenize the attitude endowments of individuals, assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other role models. This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling the socialization production function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total effect on children's economic situation.

TI  - Comparing those who do, might and will not invest in sustainable funds: a survey among German retail fund investors
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of an online questionnaire among private German mutual fund investors. In an exploratory nature, we empirically analyze the differences between three groups: sustainable investors, conventional investors that are either generally interested or those that are not interested at all to invest in socially responsible (SR) funds. We provide evidence on motives and attitudes of these three investor groups, showing that SR fund investors are quite similar to those interested in investing sustainably and very different from those who only consider investing conventionally. All three groups agree that sustainable actions of a company affect its stock price positively. Yet, they all believe that SR funds perform worse than conventional funds. Nevertheless, some still invest in SR funds. Consequently, different motives and attitudes are the determining factors when it comes to making an investment decision. These differences will be extensively discussed on the following pages.

TI  - Determinants of individual sustainable investment behavior - A framed field experiment
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper employs a new empirical approach for eliciting preferences for and determinants of sustainable investments at the individual investor level. We examine data from an incentivized framed field experiment that was part of a representative survey among financial decision makers in German households. The analysis reveals strong preferences for sustainable funds. These preferences are especially driven by non-pecuniary factors such as financial literacy, environmental values, and social norms. Interestingly, economic preferences or the Big Five personality traits are only of minor relevance. Our results provide useful implications for the discussion on how to mobilize individual investors for sustainable development.

TI  - Personality Psychology and Economics
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed about the "situational specificity" of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined. The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover, standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience, establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes. Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing poverty and disadvantage.

TI  - Preferences for sustainable and responsible equity funds - A choice experiment with Swedish private investors
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract We perform a choice experiment modeled on equity fund savings, to estimate preferences for sustainable and responsible investments and conventional fund attributes among private investors in Sweden (n = 559). We find that sustainability strategies, as well as an environmental focus, were more important than other fund characteristics. Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics. These results can serve to identify market segments so that equity fund offerings, including those related to SRI, can be mobilized, optimized and tailored to meet the demand for SRI among private investors.

TI  - Planning and Financial Literacy: How Do Women Fare?
PY  - 2008
AB  - Many older US households have done little or no planning for retirement, and there is a substantial population that seems to undersave for retirement. Of particular concern is the relative position of older women, who are more vulnerable to old-age poverty due to their longer longevity. This paper uses data from a special module we devised on planning and financial literacy in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study. It shows that women display much lower levels of financial literacy than the older population as a whole. In addition, women who are less financially literate are also less likely to plan for retirement and be successful planners. These findings have important implications for policy and for programs aimed at fostering financial security at older ages.

TI  - COVENANTS WITH AND WITHOUT A SWORD: SELF-GOVERNANCE IS POSSIBLE
PY  - 1992
AB  - Contemporary political theory often assumes that individuals cannot make credible commitments where substantial temptations exist to break them unless such commitments are enforced by an external agent. One such situation may occur in relation to common pool resources, which are natural or man-made resources whose yield is subtractable and whose exclusion is nontrivial (but not necessarily impossible). Examples include fisheries, forests, grazing ranges, irrigation systems, and groundwater basins. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that appropriators in common pool resources develop credible commitments in many cases without relying on external authorities. We present findings from a series of experiments exploring (1) covenants alone (both one-shot and repeated communication opportunities); (2) swords alone (repeated opportunities to sanction each other); and (3) covenants combined with an internal sword (one-shot communication followed by repeated opportunities to sanction each other).

TI  - Discounting and Reciprocity in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
PY  - 2002
AB  - The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is a central paradigm in the study of animal cooperation. According to the IPD framework, repeated play (repetition) and reciprocity combine to maintain a cooperative equilibrium. However, experimental studies with animals suggest that cooperative behavior in IPDs is unstable, and some have suggested that strong preferences for immediate benefits (that is, temporal discounting) might explain the fragility of cooperative equilibria. We studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on cooperation in captive blue jays. Our results demonstrate an interaction between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all other treatment combinations. This suggests that stable cooperation requires both reduced discounting and reciprocity, and it offers an explanation of earlier failures to find cooperation in controlled payoff games.

TI  - Cooperation through indirect reciprocity: image scoring or standing strategy?
PY  - 2001
AB  - Theorists have only recently shown that cooperation through indirect reciprocity can evolve. The first modelling approach favoured a mechanism called image scoring. Helping someone increases one's image score, whereas refusing to help reduces it. The evolutionary outcome was a discriminator image scoring strategy that helps everybody who has, for example, a positive image score. Two experimental studies with humans found results that were compatible with discriminator image scoring. However, a new analysis of other theorists, based on another population structure, has cast doubts on the evolutionary stability of strategies using the recipient's score as a sole basis for decision. The new theoretical study confirmed that a strategy aiming at "good standing" has superior properties and easily beats image scoring. An individual loses good standing by failing to help a recipient in good standing, whereas failing to help recipients who lack good standing does not damage the standing of a potential donor (but would reduce his image score). The present empirical study with 23 groups of seven human subjects each was designed for distinguishing between the two proposed mechanisms experimentally. The results differed strongly from standing strategies, which might demand too much working memory capacity, but were compatible with image scoring or a similar strategy to a large extent. Furthermore, donors of constant "NO players" compensated for their refusing to help these players by being more generous to others.

TI  - Giving According to GARP: An Experimental Test of the Consistency of Preferences for Altruism
PY  - 2002
AB  - Subjects in economic laboratory experiments have clearly expressed an interest in behaving unselfishly. They cooperate in prisoners’ dilemma games, they give to public goods, and they leave money on the table when bargaining. While some are tempted to call this behavior irrational, economists should ask if this unselfish and altruistic behavior is indeed self-interested. That is, can subjects’ concerns for altruism or fairness be expressed in the economists’ language of a well-behaved preference ordering? If so, then behavior is consistent and meets our definition of rationality. This paper explores this question by applying the axioms of revealed preference to the altruistic actions of subjects. If subjects adhere to these axioms, such as GARP, then we can infer that a continuous, convex, and monotonic utility function could have generated their choices. This means that an economic model is sufficient to understand the data and that, in fact, altruism is rational. We do this by offering subjects several opportunities to share a surplus with another anonymous subject. However, the costs of sharing and the surplus available vary across decisions. This price and income variation creates budgets for altruistic activity that allow us to test for an underlying preference ordering. We found that subjects exhibit a significant degree of rationally altruistic behavior. Over 98% of our subjects made choices that are consistent with utility maximization. Only a quarter of subjects are selfish money-maximizers, and the rest show varying degrees of altruism. Perhaps most strikingly, almost half of the subjects exhibited behavior that is exactly consistent with one of three standard CES utility functions: perfectly selfish, perfect substitutes, or Leontief. Those with Leontief preferences are always dividing the surplus equally, while those with perfect substitutes preferences give everything away when the price of giving is less than one, but keep everything when the price of giving is greater than one. Using the data on choices, we estimated a population of utility functions and applied these to predict the results of other studies. We found that our results could successfully characterize the outcomes of other studies, indicating still further that altruism can be captured in an economic model.

TI  - A theory of human life history evolution: Diet, intelligence, and longevity
PY  - 2000
AB  - Human life histories as compared to those of other primates and mammals have at least four distinctive characteristics: an exceptionally long life span an extended period of juvenile dependence support of reproduction by older post-reproductive individuals and male support of reproduction through the provisioning of females and their offspring. Another distinctive feature of our species is a large brain with its associated psychological attributes: increased capacities for learning cognition and insight. In this paper the authors propose a theory that unites and organizes these observations and generates many theoretical and empirical predictions. The authors present some tests of those predictions and outline new predictions that can be tested in future research by comparative biologists archaeologists paleontologists biological anthropologists demographers geneticists and cultural anthropologists.

TI  - The social psychology of groups
PY  - 1959
AB  - This landmark theory of interpersonal relations and group functioning argues that the starting point for understanding social behavior is the analysis of dyadic interdependence. Such an analysis portrays the ways in which the separate and joint actions of two persons affect the quality of their lives and the survival of their relationship. The authors focus on patterns of interdependence, and on the assumption that these patterns play an important causal role in the processes, roles, and norms of relationships. This powerful theory has many applications in all the social sciences, including the study of social and moral norms; close-pair relationships; conflicts of interest and cognitive disputes; social orientations; the social evolution of economic prosperity and leadership in groups; and personal relationships.

TI  - Swift Neighbors and Persistent Strangers: A Cross- Cultural Investigation of Trust and Reciprocity in Social Exchange
PY  - 2002
AB  - In four countries, levels of trust and reciprocity in direct‐reciprocal exchange are compared with those in network‐generalized exchanges among experimentally manipulated groups' members (neighbors) or random experimental participants (strangers). Results show that cooperation decreases as social distance increases; and, that identical network‐generalized exchanges generate different amounts of trusting behavior due solely to manipulated social identity between the actors. This study demonstrates the interaction of culture and social identity on the propensity to trust and reciprocate and also reveals differing relationships between trust and reciprocation in each of the four countries, bringing into question the theoretical relationship between these cooperative behaviors.

TI  - Reciprocity, trust, and the sense of control : A cross-societal study
PY  - 1999
AB  - Most cognitive approaches for explaining cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma games include the view that many people believe that mutual cooperation is generally a gainful strategy to all parties and will cooperate when they think their partner cooperates. Proceeding along these lines, we argue that many participants treat a Prisoner's Dilemma game as an assurance game, and respond in a reciprocal manner to the choice or expected choice of their partner. We examine two bases for the expectation of a partner's cooperation in one-shot games: `general trust' and a `sense of control'. Further, we discuss why we expect general trust and a `sense of control'. Further, we discuss why we expect general trust and a sense of control to play different roles in societies, particularly in Japanese society and American society. Specifically, we test a general hypothesis that a sense of control plays a relatively more important role as a foundation for expectations in Japanese society and general trust plays the more impo...

TI  - A CONDITION FOR GROUP SELECTION TO PREVAIL OVER COUNTERACTING INDIVIDUAL SELECTION.
PY  - 1982
AB  - The importance of group selection as an evolutionary force has been much debated (see Wilson, 1973; Maynard Smith, 1976; Wade, 1978, for recent critiques). Whenever a population is subdivided into groups of mating individuals (i.e., demes) between which there is complete or partial isolation, the differential extinction or proliferation of those groups becomes a possible force for directional genetic change, to be superposed on selection at the individual level. Of particular interest, and this is the problem which I address, is whether group selection can prevail over individual selection to bring about the evolution of an altruistic trait. An altruistic trait is here defined as a trait which is detrimental to the fitness of the individual who expresses it but which confers an advantage on the group of which that individual is a member in the form of, for example, a reduced probability of group extinction. Seminal papers on the subject are Haldane (1932) and Wright (1945). The basic problem of group selection is how the genetic differentiation of groups, a sine qua non for group selection to occur, can be maintained when many forces including group selection tend to diminish it (Slatkin, 1980). More concretely, in the haploid one-locus two-allele no mutation model which we analyze in this paper, where genetic differentiation of groups is generated in most part by random genetic drift and reduced partly by migration, are the parameter values, e.g., deme size, migration rate, etc. which need to be postulated to permit the evolution of altruism by group selection, of realistic magnitude? A related question is, what is the appropriate measure of genetic differentiation? There are differing definitions and formulations of group selection (see Maynard Smith, 1976; Wade, 1978; Uyenoyama, 1979). The model which I analyze is based on the models of Levins (1970) (see also Boorman and Levitt, 1980 p. 289-32 1), Eshel (1972), and Levin and Kilmer (1974). The intuitive concept of a group is a partially isolated set of mating individuals with potential continuity across many individual lifetimes. Some examples are a "clan" of hyenas, an "unit group" of chimpanzees, a "settlement" of Pleistocene hominids. In addition to the aforementioned authors, Boorman and Levitt (1972, 1973) and Cohen and Eshel (1976) also appear to adopt this view of a group. However, in some recent models (D. S. Wilson, 1975; Matessi and Jayakar, 1976), a "group" has but an ephemeral existence, the group structure being dissolved each generation to form a random mating whole. The model actually analyzed by Uyenoyama (1979) also has this property. The life cycles of many species do indeed comply with this pattern, particularly if the "group" is identified with a sibship. Such models should perhaps be referred to as hierarchically-structured to distinguish them from the "traditional" (Wade, 1978) group models. With respect to the origin or maintenance of the between-group variation so necessary for group selection to be effective, the models of Levins (1970), Eshel (1972), and Levin and Kilmer (1974) invoke random genetic drift; those of Wilson (1975), Matessi and Jayakar (1976), Cohen and Eshel (1976), and in effect Boorman and Levitt (1972, 1973) depend on the "founder" effect; and Uyenoyama's model (1979) is new in that it introduces I Contribution No. 1387 from the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka-ken, 411 Japan.

TI  - Cooperation Through Image Scoring in Humans
PY  - 2000
AB  - The "tragedy of the commons," that is, the selfish exploitation of resources in the public domain, is a reason for many of our everyday social conflicts. However, humans are often more helpful to others than evolutionary theory would predict, unless indirect reciprocity takes place and is based on image scoring (which reflects the way an individual is viewed by a group), as recently shown by game theorists. We tested this idea under conditions that control for confounding factors. Donations were more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. This shows that image scoring promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely.

TI  - Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity
PY  - 2001
AB  - How can cooperation through indirect reciprocity evolve and what would it be like? This problem has previously been studied by simulating evolution in a small group of interacting individuals, assuming no gene flow between groups. In these simulations, certain 'image scoring' strategies were found to be the most successful. However, analytical arguments show that it would not be in an individual's interest to use these strategies. Starting with this puzzle, we investigate indirect reciprocity in simulations based on an island model. This has an advantage in that the role of genetic drift can be examined. Our results show that the image scoring strategies depend on very strong drift or a very small cost of giving help. As soon as these factors are absent, selection eliminates image scoring. We also consider other possibilities for the evolution of indirect reciprocity. In particular, we find that the strategy of aiming for 'good standing' has superior properties. It can be an evolutionarily stable strategy and, even if not, it usually beats image scoring. Furthermore, by introducing quality variation among individuals into the model, we show that the standing strategy can be quality revealing, adding a new dimension to indirect reciprocity. Finally, we discuss general problems with currently popular modelling styles.

TI  - Do High Stakes and Competition Undermine Fairness? Evidence from Russia
PY  - 2002
AB  - This paper reports the results of a series of competitive labour market experiments in which subjects have the possibility to reciprocate favours. In the high stake condition subjects earned between two and three times their monthly income during the experiment. In the normal stake condition the stake level was reduced by a factor of ten. We observe that both in the high and the normal stake condition fairness concerns are strong enough to outweigh competitive forces and give rise to non-competitive wages. There is also no evidence that effort behaviour becomes generally more selfish at higher stake levels. Therefore, our results suggest that, contrary to common beliefs, fairness concerns may play an important role even at relatively high stake levels.

TI  - Rational Cooperation in the Finitely Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma: Experimental Evidence
PY  - 1993
AB  - This paper presents experiments designed to examine the sequential equilibrium reputation hypothesis in the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. The authors test the hypothesis by controlling the subjects' ability to build reputations and by manipulating their beliefs that their opponent is irrational or altruistic. The responses of subjects strongly support the sequential equilibrium prediction. The results also suggest an important role for 'homemade altruism,' that is, a natural tendency to cooperate that subjects bring to the experiment from the outside. The authors find that there may be no difference between the beliefs that an opponent is altruistic and the actual chance it is so. Copyright 1993 by Royal Economic Society.

TI  - The evolution of altruistic punishment
PY  - 2003
AB  - Both laboratory and field data suggest that people punish noncooperators even in one-shot interactions. Although such “altruistic punishment” may explain the high levels of cooperation in human societies, it creates an evolutionary puzzle: existing models suggest that altruistic cooperation among nonrelatives is evolutionarily stable only in small groups. Thus, applying such models to the evolution of altruistic punishment leads to the prediction that people will not incur costs to punish others to provide benefits to large groups of nonrelatives. However, here we show that an important asymmetry between altruistic cooperation and altruistic punishment allows altruistic punishment to evolve in populations engaged in one-time, anonymous interactions. This process allows both altruistic punishment and altruistic cooperation to be maintained even when groups are large and other parameter values approximate conditions that characterize cultural evolution in the small-scale societies in which humans lived for most of our prehistory.

TI  - Strong reciprocity, human cooperation, and the enforcement of social norms.
PY  - 2002
AB  - This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this behavioral propensity "strong reciprocity" and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.

TI  - Relational contracts and the nature of market interactions
PY  - 2004
AB  - We provide evidence that long-term relationships between trading parties emerge endogenously in the absence of third party enforcement of contracts and are associated with a fundamental change in the nature of market interactions. Without third party enforcement, the vast majority of trades are initiated with private offers and the parties share the gains from trade equally. Low effort or bad quality is penalized by the termination of the relationship, wielding a powerful effect on contract enforcement. Successful long-term relations exhibit generous rent sharing and high effort (quality) from the very beginning of the relationship. In the absence of third-party enforcement, markets resemble a collection of bilateral trading islands rather than a competitive market. If contracts are third party enforceable, rent sharing and long-term relations are absent and the vast majority of trades are initiated with public offers. Most trades take place in one-shot transactions and the contracting parties are indifferent with regard to the identity of their trading partner.

TI  - Preferences, property rights, and anonymity in bargaining games
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Research on ultimatum and dictator games has found that because of "fairness" first movers in such games offer more than noncooperative game theory predicts. We find that if the right to be the first mover is "earned" by scoring high on a general knowledge quiz, then first movers behave in a more self-regarding manner. We also conducted dictator double blind experiments, in which the experimenter could not identify the decision maker. The results yielded by far our largest observed incidence of self-regarding offers, suggesting that offers are due to strategic and expectation considerations.

TI  - The allelic correlation structure of Gainj- and Kalam-speaking people. I. The estimation and interpretation of Wright's F-statistics.
PY  - 1986
AB  - The internal patterning of allelic correlations in the Gainj and Kalam swidden horticulturalists of highland Papua New Guinea is examined within the context of Sewall Wright's F-statistic model. A multiallelic extension of the model is given first, and multivariate variance-component estimators for the parameters are suggested. Then, it is shown that the expectation of the F-statistic set depends on the age structure of the population and that knowledge of the population and sample age structure is critical for meaningful analysis. The array of F-statistics estimated jointly over five polymorphic enzyme loci reveals the following features of Gainj and Kalam population structure: (1) significant departures from panmictic expectations and (2) characteristics of a continuously distributed breeding population, rather than those expected for populations subdivided into demes with discrete boundaries. Finally, the F-statistics estimated for the Gainj and Kalam are briefly compared to estimates obtained from other tribal populations. It is seen that the level of differentiation observed in the Gainj and Kalam is only about one-third that observed in South American swidden horticulturalists. Consequently, some conventional wisdom regarding the interrelationship of socioecological settings and genetic structures may require reevaluation.

TI  - Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Human groups maintain a high level of sociality despite a low level of relatedness among group members. This paper reviews the evidence for an empirically identifiable form of prosocial behavior in humans, which we call “strong reciprocity”, that may in part explain human sociality. A strong reciprocator is predisposed to cooperate with others and punish non-cooperators, even when this behavior cannot be justified in terms of extended kinship or reciprocal altruism. We present a simple model, stylized but plausible, of the evolutionary emergence of strong reciprocity.

TI  - Evolutionary social psychology and family homicide.
PY  - 1988
AB  - Homicide is an extreme manifestation of interpersonal conflict with minimal reporting bias and can thus be used as a conflict "assay." Evolutionary models of social motives predict that genetic relationship will be associated with mitigation of conflict, and various analyses of homicide data support this prediction. Most "family" homicides are spousal homicides, fueled by male sexual proprietariness. In the case of parent-offspring conflict, an evolutionary model predicts variations in the risk of violence as a function of the ages, sexes, and other characteristics of protagonists, and these predictions are upheld in tests with data on infanticides, parricides, and filicides.

TI  - Decision Making with Naive Advice
PY  - 2003
AB  - In many of the decisions we make we rely on the advice of others who have preceded us. For example, before we buy a car, choose a dentist, choose a spouse, find a school for our children, sign on to a retirement plan, etc. we usually ask the advice of others who have experience with such decisions. The same is true when we make major financial decisions. Here people easily take advice from their fellow workers or relatives as to how to choose stock, balance a portfolio, or save for their child’s education. Although some advice we get is from experts, most of the time we make our decisions relying only on the rather uninformed word-of-mouth advice we get from our friends or neighbors. We call this ?aive advice? In this paper I will outline a set of experimental results that indicate that word-of-mouth advice is a very powerful force in shaping the decisions that people make and tends to push those decisions in the direction of the predictions of the rational theory.

AB  - Social norms that induce us to reward or punish people not for what they did to us but for what they did to other members of one’s group have long been thought as sine qua non sociological and thus impossible to explain in terms of rational choice. This article shows how social norms can be deductively derived from principles of (boundedly) rational choice as mechanisms that are necessary to stabilize behaviors in a large class of evolutionary games.

TI  - Altruism as a Handicap: The Limitations of Kin Selection and Reciprocity
PY  - 1995
AB  - The phenomenon of "helping at the nest" has exposed ornithologists to the problem of the evolution of altruism, i.e. why should a non-breeder invest in the fitness of breeders rather than trying itself to breed. Until the 1960s altruism was explained by many biologists through models of "group selection" (GS), i.e. the investment of the non-breeders in the breeding of their group members was justified by its contribution to the group. GS was later rejected by most evolutionary biologists (Maynard Smith 1964, Lack 1966, Williams 1966), and another model, that of "kin-selection" (KS) (Hamilton 1964) was suggested as an alternative solution to the problem of altruism. In KS models the investment of the altruist is justified by the benefit to its relatives. However, the many studies on group living birds which have resulted from the growing interest in the dilemma of altruism, have revealed that the helpers are in fact often not related to the breeders (Ligon and Ligon 1990, Reyer 1990, Zahavi 1990). Trivers (1971) suggested an additional model "reciprocal altruism" (RA) to interpret altruistic adaptations among non-relatives. This latter model suggests that the investment of the altruist is compensated by a gain from a reciprocal investment by other group members. However, data from several field studies have indicated that in many cases the act of the non-related altruist was not reciprocated. In these cases neither KS nor RA could explain helping at the nest. It was evident, however, in some of these studies (Ligon and Ligon 1990, Reyer 1990, Zahavi 1990) that many of the helpers were enhancing their own chances to breed. Helping by nonrelated birds, which is not reciprocated, can therefore only be interpreted as a simple selfish investment. However, these findings did not stimulate further research into the possibility that "helpers" in general gain direct advantages by their apparently altruistic investment.

TI  - The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism
PY  - 1971
AB  - A model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. The model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance ap...

AB  - During the period from about 1818 to 1890 the Nuer increased their territorial domain fourfold. Their displacement of the Dinka (and Anuak) represents one of the most prominent instances of tribal imperialism contained in the ethnographic record. The primary objective of this study is to resolve the mystery of this sudden expansion and to provide answers to the four central questions posed by the conquest: 1) the proximate and underlying causes of Nuer territorial appropriation; 2) the means by which this was accomplished, and particularly the nature of the decisive Nuer advantage that enabled them to so readily displace neighbouring groups; 3) the developmental process of divergence from a common stock that eventuated in Nuer hegemony (and entailed significant structural changes); 4) the factors that account for Nuer, rather than Dinka, development of both the impetus to territorial acquisition and the capacity to bring this about.

TI  - An experimental analysis of ultimatum bargaining
PY  - 1982
AB  - There are many experimental studies of bargaining behavior, but suprisingly enough nearly no attempt has been made to investigate the so-called ultimatum bargaining behavior experimentally. The special property of ultimatum bargaining games is that on every stage of the bargaining process only one player has to decide and that before the last stage the set of outcomes is already restricted to only two results. To make the ultimatum aspect obvious we concentrated on situations with two players and two stages. In the ‘easy games’ a given amount c has to be distributed among the two players, whereas in the ‘complicated games’ the players have to allocate a bundle of black and white chips with different values for both players. We performed two main experiments for easy games as well as for complicated games. By a special experiment it was investigated how the demands of subjects as player 1 are related to their acceptance decisions as player 2.

PY  - 2003
AB  - <jats:p>The latest interdisciplinary research on the evolutionary models of cooperation.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Current thinking in evolutionary biology holds that competition among individuals is the key to understanding natural selection. When competition exists, it is obvious that conflict arises; the emergence of cooperation, however, is less straightforward and calls for in-depth analysis. Much research is now focused on defining and expanding the evolutionary models of cooperation. Understanding the mechanisms of cooperation has relevance for fields other than biology. Anthropology, economics, mathematics, political science, primatology, and psychology are adopting the evolutionary approach and developing analogies based on it. Similarly, biologists use elements of economic game theory and analyze cooperation in "evolutionary games." Despite this, exchanges between researchers in these different disciplines have been limited. Seeking to fill this gap, the 90th Dahlem Workshop was convened. This book, which grew out of that meeting, addresses such topics as emotions in human cooperation, reciprocity, biological markets, cooperation and conflict in multicellularity, genomic and intercellular cooperation, the origins of human cooperation, and the cultural evolution of cooperation; the emphasis is on open questions and future research areas. The book makes a significant contribution to a growing process of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization on this issue.</jats:p>

TI  - A Nation-Wide Laboratory: Examining Trust and Trustworthiness by Integrating Behavioral Experiments into Representative Surveys
PY  - 2003
AB  - Typically, laboratory experiments suffer from homogeneous subject pools and self-selection biases. The usefulness of survey data is limited by measurement error and by the questionability of their behavioural relevance. Here we present a method integrating interactive experiments and representative surveys thereby overcoming crucial weaknesses of both approaches. One of the major advantages of our approach is that it allows for the integration of experiments, which require interaction among the participants, with a survey of non-interacting respondents in a smooth and inexpensive way. We illustrate the power of our approach with the analysis of trust and trustworthiness in Germany by combining representative survey data with representative behavioural data from a social dilemma experiment. We identify which survey questions intended to elicit people’s trust correlate well with behaviourally exhibited trust in the experiment. People above the age of 65, highly-skilled workers and people living in bigger households exhibit less trusting behaviour. Foreign citizens, Catholics and people favouring the Social Democratic Party or the Christian Democratic Party exhibit more trust. People above the age of 65 and those in good health behave more trustworthy or more altruistically, respectively. People below the age of 35, the unemployed and people who say they are in favour of none of the political parties behave less trustworthy or less altruistically, respectively.

TI  - Fairness Versus Reason in the Ultimatum Game
PY  - 2000
AB  - In the Ultimatum Game, two players are offered a chance to win a certain sum of money. All they must do is divide it. The proposer suggests how to split the sum. The responder can accept or reject the deal. If the deal is rejected, neither player gets anything. The rational solution, suggested by game theory, is for the proposer to offer the smallest possible share and for the responder to accept it. If humans play the game, however, the most frequent outcome is a fair share. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary approach to the Ultimatum Game. We show that fairness will evolve if the proposer can obtain some information on what deals the responder has accepted in the past. Hence, the evolution of fairness, similarly to the evolution of cooperation, is linked to reputation.

TI  - The handbook of experimental economics
PY  - 1995
AB  - This book, which comprises eight chapters, presents a comprehensive critical survey of the results and methods of laboratory experiments in economics. The first chapter provides an introduction to experimental economics as a whole, with the remaining chapters providing surveys by leading practitioners in areas of economics that have seen a concentration of experiments: public goods, coordination problems, bargaining, industrial organization, asset markets, auctions, and individual decision making.

TI  - Indirect Reciprocity and Strategic Reputation Building in an Experimental Helping Game
PY  - 2003
AB  - We study indirect reciprocity and strategic reputation building in an experimental helping game. At any time only half of the subjects can build a reputation. This allows us to study both pure indirect reciprocity that is not contaminated by strategic reputation building and the impact of incentives for strategic reputation building on the helping rate. We find that while pure indirect reciprocity appears to be important, the helping choice seems to be influenced at least as much by strategic considerations. Strategic do better than non-strategic players and non-reciprocal do better than reciprocal players, casting doubt on previously proposed evolutionary explanations for indirect reciprocity.

TI  - Third Party Punishment and Social Norms
PY  - 2004
AB  - We examine the characteristics and relative strength of third-party sanctions in a series of experiments. We hypothesize that egalitarian distribution norms and cooperation norms apply in our experiments, and that third parties, whose economic payoff is unaffected by the norm violation, may be willing to enforce these norms although the enforcement is costly for them. Almost two-thirds of the third parties indeed punished the violation of the distribution norm and their punishment increased the more the norm was violated. Likewise, up to roughly 60% of the third parties punished violations of the cooperation norm. Thus, our results show that the notion of strong reciprocity extends to the sanctioning behavior of ‘‘unaffected’’ third parties. In addition, these experiments suggest that thirdparty punishment games are powerful tools for studying the characteristics and the content of social norms. Further experiments indicate that second parties, whose economic payoff is reduced by the norm violation, punish the violation much more strongly than do third parties.

TI  - A neural basis for social cooperation
PY  - 2002
AB  - Cooperation based on reciprocal altruism has evolved in only a small number of species, yet it constitutes the core behavioral principle of human social life. The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game has been used to model this form of cooperation. We used fMRI to scan 36 women as they played an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with another woman to investigate the neurobiological basis of cooperative social behavior. Mutual cooperation was associated with consistent activation in brain areas that have been linked with reward processing: nucleus accumbens, the caudate nucleus, ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. We propose that activation of this neural network positively reinforces reciprocal altruism, thereby motivating subjects to resist the temptation to selfishly accept but not reciprocate favors.

TI  - RAISING THE STAKES IN THE ULTIMATUM GAME: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM INDONESIA
PY  - 1999
AB  - The ultimatum game has generated considerable interest because experimental evidence strongly rejects the standard game-theoretic predictions. A limitation to this general result is the possibility that experimental results are an artifact of small stakes. Implementing the ultimatum game in Indonesia makes it possible to raise the stakes to three times the monthly expenditure of the average participant. Even with these sizable incentives, results do not uniformly approach the sub-game perfect, selfish outcomes. More specifically, responders become more willing to accept a given percentage offer at higher stakes, but proposer behavior is largely invariant to stake changes. (JEL C91, C78)

TI  - Give unto others: genetically unrelated cotton-top tamarin monkeys preferentially give food to those who altruistically give food back
PY  - 2003
AB  - Altruistic food giving among genetically unrelated individuals is rare in nature. The few examples that exist suggest that when animals give food to unrelated others, they may do so on the basis of mutualistic or reciprocally altruistic relationships. We present the results of four experiments designed to tease apart the factors mediating food giving among genetically unrelated cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus), a cooperatively breeding New World primate. In experiment 1 we show that individuals give significantly more food to a trained conspecific who unilaterally gives food than to a conspecific who unilaterally never gives food. The apparent contingency of the tamarins' food-giving behaviour motivated the design of experiments 2-4. Results from all three experiments show that altruistic food giving is mediated by prior acts of altruistic food giving by a conspecific. Specifically, tamarins do not give food to unrelated others when the food received in the past represents the by-product of another's selfish actions (experiments 2 and 3) or when a human experimenter gives them food (experiment 4) as did the unilateral altruist in experiment 1. By contrast, if one tamarin gives another food without obtaining any immediate benefit, then the recipient is more likely to give food in return. Overall, results show that tamarins altruistically give food to genetically unrelated conspecifics, discriminate between altruistic and selfish actions, and give more food to those who give food back. Tamarins therefore have the psychological capacity for reciprocally mediated altruism.

TI  - Genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation
PY  - 2003
AB  - The latest interdisciplinary research on the evolutionary models of cooperation. Current thinking in evolutionary biology holds that competition among individuals is the key to understanding natural selection. When competition exists, it is obvious that conflict arises; the emergence of cooperation, however, is less straightforward and calls for in-depth analysis. Much research is now focused on defining and expanding the evolutionary models of cooperation. Understanding the mechanisms of cooperation has relevance for fields other than biology. Anthropology, economics, mathematics, political science, primatology, and psychology are adopting the evolutionary approach and developing analogies based on it. Similarly, biologists use elements of economic game theory and analyze cooperation in "evolutionary games." Despite this, exchanges between researchers in these different disciplines have been limited. Seeking to fill this gap, the 90th Dahlem Workshop was convened. This book, which grew out of that meeting, addresses such topics as emotions in human cooperation, reciprocity, biological markets, cooperation and conflict in multicellularity, genomic and intercellular cooperation, the origins of human cooperation, and the cultural evolution of cooperation; the emphasis is on open questions and future research areas. The book makes a significant contribution to a growing process of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization on this issue.

TI  - Group Size Effects in Public Goods Provision: The Voluntary Contributions Mechanism
PY  - 1988
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between variations in group size and "free-riding" behavior in the voluntary provision of public goods. We examine experimentally two pertinent concepts: the marginal return to an individual from contributions to the public good, and the actual number of members in the group. Our results strongly support a hypothesis that increasing group size leads to a reduction in allocative efficiency when accompanied by a decrease in marginal return from the public good (as from crowding or an association of large groups with imperceptibility of marginal benefits). Our results do not support a pure numbers-in-the-group effect.

TI  - Adoption and Kinship in Oceania
PY  - 1980
AB  - The frequency and form of adoption practices in Oceania recently have been cited as evidence that human behavior is inconsistent with predictions derived from sociobiological theory (Sahlins 1976). Ethnographic data reviewed here, however, suggest otherwise. In Oceania kinship is an important factor in the selection and treatment of adopted children as adoption occurs almost exclusively among close relatives. Natal children often ally against their adopted siblings over the division of their common parents' estate while adoptive parents themselves frequently apportion their land unequally among their natal and adopted children. These patterns and other data are consistent with predictions generated by a socio biological model of adoptive decisions. The model illustrates how kinship facilitates adoption as a means of modifying extreme family sizes, and how asymmetries in the degrees of relatedness between parents and their adopted and natal children provide the basis of differential treatment of them. Adoption in Oceania provides an example of a clearly cultural behavior which is consistent with socio biological predictions, and suggests that both culture and biology are relevant to an understanding of human behavior.

TI  - The Evolution of Social Norms in Common Property Resource Use
PY  - 1996
AB  - The problem of extracting commonly owned renewable resources is examined within an evolutionary-game-theoretic framework. It is shown that cooperative behavior guided by norms of restraint and punishment may be stable in a well-defined sense against invasion by narrowly self-interested behavior. The resource-stock dynamics are integrated with the evolutionary-game dynamics. Effects of changes in prices, technology, and social cohesion on extraction behavior and the long-run stock are analyzed. When threshold values of the parameters are crossed, social norms can break down leading generally to the lowering of the long-run stock and possibly to its extinction.

TI  - Evolution of Conventions in an Experimental Public Goods Game with Private and Public Knowledge of Advice
PY  - 2003
AB  - We adopt an inter-generational approach to the public goods game where at the end of		 each session one generation of subjects leave advice for the succeeding generation		 via free form messages. Such advice can be private (advice left by one player in		 generation t is given only to her immediate successor in generation t+1) or public		 (advice left by players of generation t is made available to all members of generation t+1). We find that when advice is public it generates a process of social		 learning that helps increase contributions over time and also mitigates problems of free riding. Our results suggest that contrary to game theoretic predictions,		 communities may be able to achieve efficient or near efficient levels of public good provision on the basis of private contributions.

TI  - Reputation and Reciprocity: Consequences for the Labour Relation
PY  - 2002
AB  - Recent evidence highlights the importance of social norms in many economic relations. However, many of these relationships are long term and provide repeated game incentives for performance. We experimentally investigate interaction effects of reciprocity and repeated game incentives in two treatments (one-shot and repeated) of a gift-exchange game. In both treatments we observe reciprocity, which is strengthened in the repeated game. A detailed analysis shows that, in the repeated game, some subjects imitate reciprocity. Thus, reciprocity and repeated game incentives reinforce each other. Observed behaviour is robust against experience. We conclude that long-term interaction is a "reciprocity-compatible" contract enforcement device.

TI  - The benefits of costly signaling: Meriam turtle hunters
PY  - 2003
AB  - Hunting, particularly when it involves large game that is extensively shared, has been suggested to serve as a form of costly signaling by hunters, serving to attract mates and allies or to deter competitors. Empirical evidence presented elsewhere on turtle hunting practiced by Meriam people of Torres Strait, Australia, supports several key predictions of the costly signaling account. Here we present evidence from the same study bearing on another key prediction, that signalers (hunters) gain social and reproductive benefits. Specifically, we find that successful hunters gain social recognition, have an earlier onset of reproduction, achieve higher age-specific reproductive success, and gain higher quality mates, who also achieve above-average reproductive success. Meriam hunters also average more mates (women who bear their offspring) and more co-resident sexual partners than other men, and these partners (but not mates) are significantly younger. Several lines of evidence thus support the idea that hunting is a form of costly signaling in this population. Alternative hypotheses involving reciprocity (from grateful recipients of meat) and direct offspring provisioning by hunters are not consistent with available evidence, but in the absence of experimental manipulation we cannot rule out a role for phenotypic correlation.

TI  - Learning in High Stakes Ultimatum Games: An Experiment in the Slovak Republic
PY  - 1998
AB  - This paper reports an experiment involving an ultimatum bargaining game, played in the Slovak Republic. Financial stakes were varied by a factor of 25, and behavior was observed both when players were inexperienced and as they gained experience. Consistent with prior results, changes in stakes had only a small effect on play for inexperienced players. But the present experimental design allows us to observe that rejections were less frequent the higher the stakes, and proposals in the high stakes conditions declined slowly as subjects gained experience. This Slovak experiment is the first to detect a lower frequency of rejection when stakes are higher and this can be explained by the added power due to multiple observations per subject in the experimental design. A model of learning suggests that the lower rejection frequency is the reason that the proposers in the higher stakes conditions of the ultimatum game learn to make lower offers.

TI  - In search of homo economicus: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies
PY  - 2001
AB  - We can summarize our results as follows. First, the canonical model is not supported in any society studied. Second, there is considerably more behavioral variability across groups than had been found in previous cross-cultural research, and the canonical model fails in a wider variety of ways than in previous experiments. Third, group-level differences in economic organization and the degree of market integration explain a substantial portion of the behavioral variation across societies: the higher the degree of market integration and the higher the payoffs to cooperation, the greater the level of cooperation in experimental games. Fourth, individual-level economic and demographic variables do not explain behavior either within or across groups. Fifth, behavior in the experiments is generally consistent with economic patterns of everyday life in these societies.

TI  - The biology of moral systems
PY  - 1987
AB  - Despite wide acceptance that the attributes of living creatures have appeared through a cumulative evolutionary process guided chiefly by natural selection, many human activities have seemed analytically inaccessible through such an approach. Prominent evolutionary biologists, for example, have described morality as contrary to the direction of biological evolution, and moral philosophers rarely regard evolution as relevant to their discussions. "The Biology of Moral Systems" adopts the position that moral questions arise out of conflicts of interest, and that moral systems are ways of using confluences of interest at lower levels of social organization to deal with conflicts of interest at higher levels. Moral systems are described as systems of indirect reciprocity: humans gain and lose socially and reproductively not only by direct transactions, but also by the reputations they gain from the everyday flow of social interactions. The author develops a general theory of human interests, using senescence and effort theory from biology, to help analyze the patterning of human lifetimes. He argues that the ultimate interests of humans are reproductive, and that the concept of morality has arisen within groups because of its contribution to unity in the context, ultimately, of success in intergroup competition. He contends that morality is not easily relatable to universals, and he carries this argument into a discussion of what he calls the greatest of all moral problems, the nuclear arms race. "Crammed with sage observations on moral dilemmas and many reasons why an understanding of evolution based on natural selection will advance thinking in finding practical solutions to our most difficult social problems."

PY  - 1991
AB  - In an experiment comparing two-person bargaining and multiperson markets in Israel, Japan, the United States, and Yugoslavia, market outcomes converged to equilibrium everywhere, with no payoff-relevant differences between countries. Bargaining outcomes were everywhere different from equilibrium predictions (both in agreements and in the substantial frequency of disagreements) and differences were observed between countries. Because of the experimental design, the fact that the market behavior is the same in all countries supports the hypothesis that the observed differences are not due to differences in languages, currencies, or experimenters, but may tentatively be attributed to cultural differences.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Confidence and Financial Advice Seeking
PY  - 2016
AB  - We find that people with higher confidence in their own financial literacy are less likely to seek financial advice, but no relation between objective measures of literacy and advice seeking. The negative association between confidence and advice seeking is more pronounced among wealthy households. We base these findings on the analysis of two rich data sources from the Netherlands: the DNB Household survey and a sample of investors from a large Dutch retail bank. Our results imply that policy makers should be careful to put financial advice forward as a mechanism to curb the ill effects of low financial literacy and that steering people towards more accurate self-assessments seems a more promising route.

TI  - Social Norms and Energy Conservation
PY  - 2011
AB  - article i nfo This paper evaluates a series of programs run by a company called OPOWER to send Home Energy Report letters to residential utility customers comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors. Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of "injunctive norms" played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.

PY  - 2011
AB  - We examine financial literacy in the US using the new National Financial Capability Study, wherein we demonstrate that financial literacy is particularly low among the young, women, and the less-educated. Moreover, Hispanics and African-Americans score the least well on financial literacy concepts. Interestingly, all groups rate themselves as rather well-informed about financial matters, notwithstanding their actual performance on the key literacy questions. Finally, we show that people who score higher on the financial literacy questions are much more likely to plan for retirement, which is likely to leave them better positioned for old age. Our results will inform those seeking to target financial literacy programmes to those in most need.

In response, this paper investigates the relationship between energy poverty, health and well-being across 32 European countries, using 2012 data from the European Quality of Life Survey. We find an uneven concentration of energy poverty, poor health, and poor well-being across Europe, with Eastern and Central Europe worst affected. At the intersection of energy poverty and health, there is a higher incidence of poor health (both physical and mental) amongst the energy poor populations of most countries, compared to non-energy poor households. Interestingly, we find the largest disparities in health and well-being levels between energy poor and non-energy poor households occur within relatively equal societies, such as Sweden and Slovenia. As well as the unique challenges brought about by rapidly changing energy landscapes in these countries, we also suggest the relative deprivation theory and processes of social comparison hold some value in explaining these findings.

TI  - The Use of Cronbach’s Alpha When Developing and Reporting Research Instruments in Science Education
PY  - 2017
AB  - Cronbach’s alpha is a statistic commonly quoted by authors to demonstrate that tests and scales that have been constructed or adopted for research projects are fit for purpose. Cronbach’s alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)—usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach’s alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.

TI  - Simplification and Saving
PY  - 2013
AB  - The daunting complexity of important financial decisions can lead to procrastination. We evaluate a low-cost intervention that substantially simplifies the retirement savings plan participation decision. Individuals received an opportunity to enroll in a retirement savings plan at a pre-selected contribution rate and asset allocation, allowing them to collapse a multidimensional problem into a binary choice between the status quo and the pre-selected alternative. The intervention increases plan enrollment rates by 10 to 20 percentage points. We find that a similar intervention can be used to increase contribution rates among employees who are already participating in a savings plan.

TI  - Low Cognitive Ability And Poor Skill With Numbers May Prevent Many From Enrolling In Medicare Supplemental Coverage
PY  - 2012
AB  - Because traditional Medicare leaves substantial gaps in coverage, many people obtain supplemental coverage to limit their exposure to out-of-pocket costs. However, some Medicare beneficiaries may not be well equipped to navigate the complex supplemental coverage landscape successfully because of their lower cognitive ability or numeracy—that is, the ability to work with numbers. We found that people in the lower third of the cognitive ability and numeracy distributions were at least eleven percentage points less likely than those in the upper third to enroll in a supplemental Medicare insurance plan. This result means that many Medicare beneficiaries do not have the financial protections and other benefits that would be available to them if they were enrolled in a supplemental insurance plan. Our findings suggest that policy makers may want to consider alternatives tailored to these high-need groups, such as enhanced education and enrollment programs, simpler sets of plan choices, or even some type of aut...

TI  - Energy-related financial literacy and bounded rationality in appliance replacement attitudes: evidence from Nepal
PY  - 2020
AB  - As countries develop, they are likely to face challenges in meeting growing energy demand and in ensuring energy security. Given this, and the problem of climate change, improving demand-side energy efficiency is pivotal to ensuring sustainable development. However, agents often underinvest in energy-efficient technologies due to behavioral failures such as low levels of energy-related financial literacy, defined as the combination of energy knowledge and cognitive abilities needed to evaluate the lifetime costs of durables. Using novel data, we analyze the levels and determinants of energy-related financial literacy of households in urban areas in the eastern lowlands of Nepal, and whether it is correlated with their attitudes towards replacement of energy-inefficient appliances. We find that respondents have low levels of energy-related financial literacy, and higher levels of literacy are associated with more rational attitudes towards appliance replacement. The findings of this study are relevant to addressing the energy-efficiency gap in developing countries.

TI  - The relationship between Corporate Environmental Responsibility, employees’ biospheric values and pro-environmental behaviour at work
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Many organizations strive for Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER). This can make organizational processes and procedures more pro-environmental, but does it also promote employees’ pro-environmental behaviour? We reason that CER can encourage employees to act pro-environmentally at work by increasing the likelihood that they consider the environmental consequences of their behaviour. In two studies, we test to what extent CER affects pro-environmental behaviour at work, and whether this depends on the extent to which employees value nature and the environment (i.e., endorse biospheric values). Both studies show that stronger biospheric values and perceived CER are related to more self-reported pro-environmental behaviour at work. Interestingly, the relationship between perceived CER and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour was stronger among those with moderate to weak biospheric values. These results suggest that relative weak biospheric values are less likely to inhibit pro-environmental behaviour at work when employees believe that their organization aims to realize CER.

TI  - The Significance of Hedonic Values for Environmentally Relevant Attitudes, Preferences, and Actions
PY  - 2012
AB  - This article aimed to demonstrate that hedonic values are important for understanding environmentally relevant beliefs, preferences, and actions, next to egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric values. In four studies, the authors found consistent support for their hypothesis that hedonic, egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric values can be distinguished empirically, suggesting that the distinction between the four types of values is not only theoretically meaningful but also recognized by individuals. Importantly, in line with the authors’ expectations, hedonic values appeared to be significantly and negatively related to a range of environmentally relevant attitudes, preferences, and behaviors, even when the other values were controlled for. This suggests that it is indeed important to include hedonic values in environmental studies and that interventions aimed to promote proenvironmental actions should consider hedonic consequences of actions, as these may be important barriers for behavior change.

TI  - Family decision at the turn of the century: has the changing structure of households impacted the family decision‐making process?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Evaluation of husbands' and wives' influence in family decision making is heavily reliant on studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Since that time, profound changes have occurred in the American family. These changes may have affected the nature of decision making in the household. To examine the degree to which earlier findings are still generalisable today, hypotheses are developed and tested with a contemporary sample of 458 men and women. Results suggest that there have been significant changes in the roles assumed in the family decision-making process, with the wife gaining more influence in all decision areas. The results indicate that marketers must re-examine their marketing strategies for some products and/or services. Possible theoretical explanations are suggested to explain why these changes may have occurred. Copyright © 2002 Henry Stewart Publications.

TI  - Education and the empowerment of women in household decision‐making in Spain
PY  - 2016
AB  - It was analysed whether investment in the education of both women and men serves to empower wives resulting in more balanced household decisions being taken on matters related to consumption and financial management. They considered that household decision-making could be made by mainly the wife, mainly the husband or the couple acting jointly. They then applied multinomial probit models to the Spanish Living Conditions Survey of 2010. Results show that, when controlling for demographic, family and labour market characteristics, the level of education of both the husband and wife has a positive effect in terms of a more egalitarian decision-making process in relation to three areas of expenditure: daily shopping, expensive purchases of consumer durables and significant expenditure on children. However, only women's education has a positive effect on borrowing money and no effect of education is observed with regard to the use of savings. Results are less conclusive for households where decisions are taken primarily by the wife or husband, since men's education increases the role of husbands in the household making-decision process whereas no effect of wives' education is observed.

TI  - Financial Literacy around the World: An Overview
PY  - 2011
AB  - In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. New international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread in both well-developed and rapidly changing markets. Women are less financially literate than men, the young and the old are less financially literate than the middle-aged, and more educated people are more financially knowledgeable. Most importantly, the financially literate are more likely to plan for retirement. Instrumental variables estimates show that the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning tend to be underestimated. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.

TI  - Household energy literacy : A critical review and a conceptual typology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The concept of energy literacy is increasingly receiving more research attention within the fields of education, economics and psychology. A wide variety of definitions and approaches characterise the energy literacy literature, making comparisons and generalizability of the findings problematic. This paper aims to review and organise the energy literacy literate that focus on the understanding of domestic electricity and gas use, by providing a framework for categorisation of the different conceptual and methodological approaches. Four types of household energy literacy are distinguished based on the existing literature: 1) device energy literacy, 2) action energy literacy, 3) financial energy literacy and 4) multifaceted energy literacy. The literature on each type of energy literacy is critically reviewed, focusing on the level of household energy literacy, its predictors and its relation to energy use. We call for more common principles and measures within the energy literacy research to allow for direct comparisons and longitudinal research on household energy literacy. This would greatly improve the quality and impact of the research, which in turn will help policy makers to decide how to address (which type of) energy literacy to facilitate domestic energy conservation.

TI  - Intertemporal choice – toward an integrative framework
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intertemporal choices are decisions with consequences that play out over time. These choices range from the prosaic – how much food to eat at a meal – to life-changing decisions about education, marriage, fertility, health behaviors and savings. Intertemporal preferences also affect policy debates about long-run challenges, such as global warming. Historically, it was assumed that delayed rewards were discounted at a constant rate over time. Recent theoretical and empirical advances from economic, psychological and neuroscience perspectives, however, have revealed a more complex account of how individuals make intertemporal decisions. We review and integrate these advances. We emphasize three different, occasionally competing, mechanisms that are implemented in the brain: representation, anticipation and self-control.

TI  - Optimal Financial Knowledge and Wealth Inequality.
PY  - 2017
AB  - We show that financial knowledge is a key determinant of wealth inequality in a stochastic life cycle model with endogenous financial knowledge accumulation, where financial knowledge enables individuals to better allocate lifetime resources in a world of uncertainty and imperfect insurance. Moreover, because of how the US social insurance system works, better-educated individuals have most to gain from investing in financial knowledge. Our parsimonious specification generates substantial wealth inequality relative to a one-asset saving model and one in which returns on wealth depend on portfolio composition alone. We estimate that 30–40 percent of retirement wealth inequality is accounted for by financial knowledge.

TI  - Household transitions to energy efficient lighting
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract New energy efficient lighting technologies can significantly reduce household electricity consumption, but adoption has been slow. A unique dataset of German households is used in this paper to examine the factors associated with the replacement of old incandescent lamps (ILs) with new energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The ‘rebound’ effect of increased lamp luminosity in the transition to energy efficient bulbs is analyzed jointly with the replacement decision to account for household self-selection in bulb-type choice. Results indicate that the EU ban on ILs accelerated the pace of transition to CFLs and LEDs, while storage of bulbs significantly dampened the speed of the transition. Higher lighting needs and bulb attributes like energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, and durability spur IL replacement with CFLs or LEDs. Electricity gains from new energy efficient lighting are mitigated by 23% and 47% increases in luminosity for CFL and LED replacements, respectively. Model results suggest that taking the replacement bulb from storage and higher levels of education dampen the magnitude of these luminosity rebounds in IL to CFL transitions.

TI  - The economic importance of financial literacy: theory and evidence
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper undertakes an assessment of a rapidly growing body of economic research on financial literacy. We start with an overview of theoretical research, which casts financial knowledge as a form of investment in human capital. Endogenizing financial knowledge has important implications for welfare, as well as policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the least financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed by an examination of the impact of financial literacy on economic decision making in the United States and elsewhere. While the literature is still young, conclusions may be drawn about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and what works to remedy these gaps. A final section offers thoughts on what remains to be learned if researchers are to better inform theoretical and empirical models as well as public policy. (JEL A20, D14, G11, I20, J26)

AB  - In vielen Landern wurden Energielabels eingefuhrt, um Kaufer von Haushaltsgeraten auf deren Energieverbrauch aufmerksam zu machen. Dieser Artikel untersucht, wie Energielabels Kaufentscheidungen beeinflussen konnen. Dazu fuhren wir ein Discrete-Choice Experiment durch, bei dem etwa 5.000 Haushalte Kaufentscheidungen auf der Basis randomisiert zugewiesener Energielabels treffen. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Angabe von jahrlichen Betriebskosten auf dem EU-Energielabel die Wahl energieeffizienter Gerate unterstutzt. Zusatzlich finden wir, dass die Mehrheit der Teilnehmer Effizienzklassen hoher bewertet als den zugrunde liegenden okonomischen Wert der Energieverbrauchsunterschiede. Weiterhin deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass Informationen zu Betriebskosten Kaufentscheidungen durch zwei Kanale beeinflussen: sie lenken die Aufmerksamkeit verstarkt auf den konkreten Energieverbrauch eines Gerats und fuhren zu einer geringeren Bewertung von Unterschieden der Effizienzklassen.

TI  - Energy demand and energy efficiency in the OECD countries: A stochastic demand frontier approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper attempts to estimate a panel "frontier" whole economy aggregate energy demand function for 29 countries over the period 1978 to 2006 using parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Consequently, unlike standard energy demand econometric estimation, the energy efficiency of each country is also modeled and it is argued that this represents a measure of the underlying efficiency for each country over time, as well as the relative efficiency across the 29 OECD countries. This shows that energy intensity is not necessarily a good indicator of energy efficiency, whereas by controlling for a range of economic and other factors, the measure of energy efficiency obtained via this approach is. This is, as far as is known, the first attempt to econometrically model OECD energy demand and efficiency in this way and it is arguably particularly relevant in a world dominated by environmental concerns with the subsequent need to conserve energy and/or use it as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the results show that although for a number of countries the change in energy intensity over time might give a reasonable indication of efficiency improvements; this is not always the case. Therefore, unless this analysis is undertaken, it is not possible to know whether the energy intensity of a country is a good proxy for energy efficiency or not. Hence, it is argued that this analysis should be undertaken to avoid potentially misleading advice to policy makers.

TI  - Behavior and Energy Policy
PY  - 2010
AB  - Many countries devote substantial public resources to research and development (R&D) for energy-efficient technologies. Energy efficiency, however, depends on both these technologies and the choices of the user. Policies to affect these choices focus on price changes (e.g., subsidies for energy-efficient goods) and information disclosure (e.g., mandated energy-use labels on appliances and autos). We argue that a broader approach is merited, one that draws on insights from the behavioral sciences. Just as we use R&D to develop “hard science” into useful technological solutions, a similar process can be used to develop basic behavioral science into large-scale business and policy innovations. Cost-effectiveness can be rigorously measured using scientific field-testing. Recent examples of scaling behaviorally informed R&D into large energy conservation programs suggest that this could have very high returns.

We use original data from Ireland to test our theoretical predictions. Our results emphasize the importance of education, information and environmental awareness in the adoption decision.

TI  - Applying Insights from Behavioral Economics to Policy Design
PY  - 2014
AB  - The premise of this article is that an understanding of psychology and other social science disciplines can inform the effectiveness of the economic tools traditionally deployed in carrying out the functions of government, which include remedying market failures, redistributing income, and collecting tax revenue. An understanding of psychology can also lead to the development of different policy tools that better motivate desired behavior change or that are more cost-effective than traditional policy tools. The article outlines a framework for thinking about the psychology of behavior change in the context of market failures. It then describes the research on the effects of a variety of interventions rooted in an understanding of psychology that have policy-relevant applications. The article concludes by discussing how an understanding of psychology can also inform the use and design of traditional policy tools for behavior change, such as financial incentives.

TI  - Consumers' Perceptions and Misperceptions of Energy Costs
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper presents three initial stylized facts from the Vehicle Ownership and Alternatives Survey (VOAS), a nationally representative survey that elicits consumers' beliefs about gasoline prices and the relative energy costs of autos with different fuel economy ratings. First, American consumers devote little attention to fuel costs when purchasing autos. Second, consistent with a cognitive bias called "MPG Illusion," consumers underestimate the fuel cost differences between low-MPG vehicles and overestimate the differences between high-MPG vehicles. Third, Americans' mean and median expected future gas prices were above current prices and predictions of the futures market at the time of the survey. Although it is often argued that misperceived energy costs justify policies to encourage the sale of energy efficient durable goods, these results show that misperceptions and expectations that differ from market information could either increase or decrease energy efficiency.

TI  - Making sense of Cronbach's alpha
PY  - 2011
AB  - Medical educators attempt to create reliable and valid tests and questionnaires in order to enhance the accuracy of their assessment and evaluations. Validity and reliability are two fundamental elements in the evaluation of a measurement instrument. Instruments can be conventional knowledge, skill or attitude tests, clinical simulations or survey questionnaires. Instruments can measure concepts, psychomotor skills or affective values. Validity is concerned with the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is concerned with the ability of an instrument to measure consistently.1 It should be noted that the reliability of an instrument is closely associated with its validity. An instrument cannot be valid unless it is reliable. However, the reliability of an instrument does not depend on its validity.2 It is possible to objectively measure the reliability of an instrument and in this paper we explain the meaning of Cronbach’s alpha, the most widely used objective measure of reliability.

Calculating alpha has become common practice in medical education research when multiple-item measures of a concept or construct are employed. This is because it is easier to use in comparison to other estimates (e.g. test-retest reliability estimates)3 as it only requires one test administration. However, in spite of the widespread use of alpha in the literature the meaning, proper use and interpretation of alpha is not clearly understood. 2, 4, 5 We feel it is important, therefore, to further explain the underlying assumptions behind alpha in order to promote its more effective use. It should be emphasised that the purpose of this brief overview is just to focus on Cronbach’s alpha as an index of reliability. Alternative methods of measuring reliability based on other psychometric methods, such as generalisability theory or item-response theory, can be used for monitoring and improving the quality of OSCE examinations 6-10, but will not be discussed here.

What is Cronbach alpha?
Alpha was developed by Lee Cronbach in 195111 to provide a measure of the internal consistency of a test or scale; it is expressed as a number between 0 and 1. Internal consistency describes the extent to which all the items in a test measure the same concept or construct and hence it is connected to the inter-relatedness of the items within the test. Internal consistency should be determined before a test can be employed for research or examination purposes to ensure validity. In addition, reliability estimates show the amount of measurement error in a test. Put simply, this interpretation of reliability is the correlation of test with itself. Squaring this correlation and subtracting from 1.00 produces the index of measurement error. For example, if a test has a reliability of 0.80, there is 0.36 error variance (random error) in the scores (0.80×0.80 = 0.64; 1.00 – 0.64 = 0.36).12 As the estimate of reliability increases, the fraction of a test score that is attributable to error will decrease.2 It is of note that the reliability of a test reveals the effect of measurement error on the observed score of a student cohort rather than on an individual student. To calculate the effect of measurement error on the observed score of an individual student, the standard error of measurement must be calculated (SEM).13

If the items in a test are correlated to each other, the value of alpha is increased. However, a high coefficient alpha does not always mean a high degree of internal consistency. This is because alpha is also affected by the length of the test. If the test length is too short, the value of alpha is reduced.2, 14 Thus, to increase alpha, more related items testing the same concept should be added to the test. It is also important to note that alpha is a property of the scores on a test from a specific sample of testees. Therefore investigators should not rely on published alpha estimates and should measure alpha each time the test is administered.14


Use of Cronbach’s alpha
Improper use of alpha can lead to situations in which either a test or scale is wrongly discarded or the test is criticised for not generating trustworthy results. To avoid this situation an understanding of the associated concepts of internal consistency, homogeneity or unidimensionality can help to improve the use of alpha. Internal consistency is concerned with the interrelatedness of a sample of test items, whereas homogeneity refers to unidimensionality. A measure is said to be unidimensional if its items measure a single latent trait or construct. Internal consistency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for measuring homogeneity or unidimensionality in a sample of test items. 5, 15 Fundamentally, the concept of reliability assumes that unidimensionality exists in a sample of test items16 and if this assumption is violated it does cause a major underestimate of reliability. It has been well documented that a multidimensional test does not necessary have a lower alpha than a unidimensional test. Thus a more rigorous view of alpha is that it cannot simply be interpreted as an index for the internal consistency of a test. 5, 15, 17

Factor Analysis can be used to identify the dimensions of a test.18 Other reliable techniques have been used and we encourage the reader to consult the paper “Applied Dimensionality and Test Structure Assessment with the START-M Mathematics Test” and to compare methods for assessing the dimensionality and underlying structure of a test.19

Alpha, therefore, does not simply measure the unidimensionality of a set of items, but can be used to confirm whether or not a sample of items is actually unidimensional.5 On the other hand if a test has more than one concept or construct, it may not make sense to report alpha for the test as a whole as the larger number of questions will inevitable inflate the value of alpha. In principle therefore, alpha should be calculated for each of the concepts rather than for the entire test or scale. 2, 3 The implication for a summative examination containing heterogeneous, case-based questions is that alpha should be calculated for each case.

More importantly, alpha is grounded in the ‘tau equivalent model’ which assumes that each test item measures the same latent trait on the same scale. Therefore, if multiple factors/traits underlie the items on a scale, as revealed by Factor Analysis, this assumption is violated and alpha underestimates the reliability of the test.17 If the number of test items is too small it will also violate the assumption of tau-equivalence and will underestimate reliability.20 When test items meet the assumptions of the tau-equivalent model, alpha approaches a better estimate of reliability. In practice, Cronbach’s alpha is a lower-bound estimate of reliability because heterogeneous test items would violate the assumptions of the tau-equivalent model.5 If the calculation of “standardised item alpha” in SPSS is higher than “Cronbach’s alpha”, a further examination of the tau-equivalent measurement in the data may be essential.


Numerical values of alpha
As pointed out earlier, the number of test items, item inter-relatedness and dimensionality affect the value of alpha.5 There are different reports about the acceptable values of alpha, ranging from 0.70 to 0.95. 2, 21, 22 A low value of alpha could be due to a low number of questions, poor inter-relatedness between items or heterogeneous constructs. For example if a low alpha is due to poor correlation between items then some should be revised or discarded. The easiest method to find them is to compute the correlation of each test item with the total score test; items with low correlations (approaching zero) are deleted. If alpha is too high it may suggest that some items are redundant as they are testing the same question but in a different guise. A maximum alpha value of 0.90 has been recommended.14


Summary
High quality tests are important to evaluate the reliability of data supplied in an examination or a research study. Alpha is a commonly employed index of test reliability. Alpha is affected by the test length and dimensionality. Alpha as an index of reliability should follow the assumptions of the essentially tau-equivalent approach. A low alpha appears if these assumptions are not meet. Alpha does not simply measure test homogeneity or unidimensionality as test reliability is a function of test length. A longer test increases the reliability of a test regardless of whether the test is homogenous or not. A high value of alpha (> 0.90) may suggest redundancies and show that the test length should be shortened.

TI  - Cognitive Reflection and the Valuation of Energy Efficiency
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Based on a stated-choice experiment among about 3,600 German households heads on the purchase of electricity-using durables, this paper explores how cognitive reflection influences consumers’ valuation of energy efficiency and investigates the interaction with consumers’ response to the EU energy label. Our results indicate that consumers with low cognitive reflection value energy efficiency less. Furthermore, we demonstrate that consumers with a low level of cognitive reflection primarily choose appliances based on grade-like energy efficiency classes, rather than detailed information on annual energy use.

TI  - Aging and Strategic Learning: The Impact of Spousal Incentives on Financial Literacy.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Women tend to be less financially literate than men, consistent with a division of labor where husbands manage finances. However, women tend to outlive their husbands. I find that older women acquire financial literacy as they approach widowhood - 80 percent would catch up with their husbands by the expected onset of widowhood. These gains are not attributable to husbands' cognitive decline, as captured by cognition tests. The results are consistent with a model in which the division of labor collapses when a spouse dies: women have incentives to delay acquiring financial human capital, but also to begin learning before widowhood.

TI  - Boundedly rational consumers, energy and investment literacy, and the display of information on household appliances
PY  - 2019
AB  - It is an ongoing debate how to increase the adoption of energy-efficient light bulbs and household appliances in the presence of the so-called ‘energy efficiency gap’. One measure to support consumers’ decision-making towards the purchase of more efficient appliances is the display of energy-related information in the form of energy-efficiency labels on electric consumer products. Another measure is to educate consumers in order to increase their level of energy and investment literacy. Thus, two questions arise when it comes to the display of energy-related information on appliances: (1) What kind of information should be displayed to enable consumers to make rational and efficient choices? (2) What abilities and prior knowledge do consumers need to possess to be able to process this information? In this paper, using a series of (recursive) bivariate probit models and three samples of 583, 877 and 1375 households from three major Swiss urban areas, we show how displaying information on the future energy consumption of electrical appliances in monetary terms (CHF), rather than in physical units (kWh), increases the probability that an individual makes a calculation and identifies the appliance with the lowest lifetime cost. In addition, our econometric results suggest that individuals with a higher level of energy and, in particular, investment literacy are more likely to perform an optimization rather than relying on a decision-making heuristic. These individuals are also more likely to identify the most (cost-)efficient appliance.

TI  - Evaluating Behaviorally Motivated Policy: Experimental Evidence from the Lightbulb Market †
PY  - 2015
AB  - Imperfect information and inattention to energy costs are important potential motivations for energy efficiency standards and subsidies. We evaluate these motivations in the lightbulb market using a theoretical model and two randomized experiments. We derive welfare effects as functions of reduced-form sufficient statistics capturing economic and psychological parameters, which we estimate using a novel within-subject information disclosure experiment. The main results suggest that moderate subsidies for energy-efficient lightbulbs may increase welfare, but informational and attentional biases alone do not justify a ban on incandescent lightbulbs. Our results and techniques generate broader methodological insights into welfare analysis with misoptimizing consumers. (JEL D12, D83, H21, H31, L67, Q41, Q48) A fundamental assumption in traditional policy analysis is that people’s choices identify their true preferences. In practice, however, many policies are at least partially predicated on the idea that consumers’ choices may not maximize their own welfare. Examples include consumer financial protection, taxes and bans on drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and unhealthy foods, and subsidies and mandates for energy-efficient products. To evaluate such policies, it is necessary to extend traditional public finance analysis to allow for the possibility of consumer mistakes and to design empirical strategies that identify the necessary economic and psychological parameters. This paper carries this out in the context of energy efficiency policy.

TI  - Cognitive Abilities and Household Financial Decision Making
PY  - 2013
AB  - We analyze the effects of cognitive abilities on two examples of consumer financial decisions where suboptimal behavior is well defined. The first example refers to consumers who transfer the entire balance from an existing credit card account to a new account, but use the new card for convenience transactions, resulting in higher interest charges. The second example refers to consumers who face higher APRs because they inaccurately estimate their property value on a home equity loan or line of credit application. We match individuals from the US military for whom we have detailed test scores from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test (ASVAB), to administrative datasets of retail credit from a large financial institution. We show that our matched samples are reasonably representative of the universes from which they are drawn. We find that consumers with higher overall composite test scores, and specifically those with higher math scores, are substantially less likely to make a financial mistake later in life. These mistakes are generally not associated with the non-mathematical component scores. We also conduct some complementary analyses using two other data sources. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to show that higher ASVAB math scores are associated with lower subjective discount rates. Finally, we use the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to demonstrate that particular forms of cognitive ability matter for specific types of suboptimal behavior. We find that the mathematical component of the test is what matters most for financial decision making and financial wealth. In contrast, non-mathematical aptitudes appear to matter for non-financial forms of suboptimal behavior (e.g. failure to take medicine). The HRS results also demonstrate the large ramifications of low math ability on long-term economic success.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Using newly collected data from the RAND American Life Panel, we examine potential explanations for the gender gap in financial literacy, including the role of marriage and who within a couple makes the financial decisions. Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition reveals the majority of the gender gap in financial literacy is not explained by differences in the characteristics of men and women—but rather differences in coefficients, or how literacy is produced. We find that financial decision making of couples is not centralized in one spouse although it is sensitive to the relative education level of spouses.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Planning: Implications for Retirement Wellbeing
PY  - 2011
AB  - Relatively little is known about why people fail to plan for retirement and whether planning and information costs might affect retirement saving patterns. This paper reports on a purpose-built survey module on planning and financial literacy for the Health and Retirement Study which measures how people make financial plans, collect the information needed to make these plans, and implement the plans. We show that financial illiteracy is widespread among older Americans, particularly women, minorities, and the least educated. We also find that the financially savvy are more likely to plan and to succeed in their planning, and they rely on formal methods such as retirement calculators, retirement seminars, and financial experts, instead of family/relatives or co-workers. These results have implications for targeted financial education efforts.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Economic Outcomes: Evidence and Policy Implications.
PY  - 2015
AB  - This article reviews what we have learned over the past decade about financial literacy and its relationship to financial decision making around the world. We used three questions to survey people in several countries about their level of fundamental knowledge of economics and finance, which they need to function as effective decision makers. We find that levels of financial literacy are low not only in the United States but also in many other countries, including those with well-developed financial markets. Moreover, financial illiteracy is particularly acute for some demographic groups, especially women and those who are less educated. These findings are important, since financial literacy is linked to borrowing, saving, and spending patterns. We also offer new evidence on financial literacy among high school students, drawing on the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment implemented in 18 countries. Last, we discuss the implications of this research for policy.

TI  - Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings
PY  - 2010
AB  - In a national online survey, 505 participants reported their perceptions of energy consumption and savings for a variety of household, transportation, and recycling activities. When asked for the most effective strategy they could implement to conserve energy, most participants mentioned curtailment (e.g., turning off lights, driving less) rather than efficiency improvements (e.g., installing more efficient light bulbs and appliances), in contrast to experts' recommendations. For a sample of 15 activities, participants underestimated energy use and savings by a factor of 2.8 on average, with small overestimates for low-energy activities and large underestimates for high-energy activities. Additional estimation and ranking tasks also yielded relatively flat functions for perceived energy use and savings. Across several tasks, participants with higher numeracy scores and stronger proenvironmental attitudes had more accurate perceptions. The serious deficiencies highlighted by these results suggest that well-designed efforts to improve the public's understanding of energy use and savings could pay large dividends.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Women participate less than men in the stock market and score lower on financial literacy. We explore the link between this gender gap in stock market participation and financial literacy. Using survey data on a random sample of 1300 individuals that is representative of the Swedish population, we show that the estimated gender gap in stock market participation diminishes when we control for basic financial literacy, essentially a measure of numeracy. A gender gap in risk taking remains significant also when controlling for financial literacy.

TI  - The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k) Participation and Savings Behavior
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k) savings behavior. We have two key e ndings. First, 401(k) participation is signie cantly higher under automatic enrollment. Second, a substantial fraction of 401(k) participants hired under automatic enrollment retain both the default contribution rate and fund allocation even though few employees hired before automatic enrollment picked this particular outcome. This “ default” behavior appears to result from participant inertia and from employee perceptions of the default as investment advice. These e ndings have implications for the design of 401(k) savings plans as well as for any type of Social Security reform that includes personal accounts over which individuals have control. They also shed light more generally on the importance of both economic and noneconomic (behavioral) factors in the determination of individual savings behavior.

TI  - Bridging the Energy Efficiency Gap: Policy Insights from Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence
PY  - 2014
AB  - Despite several decades of government policies to promote energy efficiency, estimates of the costs and benefits of such policies remain controversial. At the heart of the controversy is whether there is an "energy efficiency gap," whereby consumers and firms fail to make seemingly positive net present value energy saving investments. High implicit discount rates, undervaluation of future fuel savings, and negative cost energy efficiency measures have all been discussed as evidence of the existence of a gap. We review explanations for an energy efficiency gap, including reasons why the size of the gap may be overstated, neoclassical explanations for a gap, and recent evidence from behavioral economics that has potential to help us understand why a gap could exist. Our review raises fundamental questions about traditional welfare analysis, yet we find the alternatives offered in the literature to be far from ready for use in policy analysis. Nevertheless, we offer several suggestions for policymakers and for future economic research.

We test this by measuring whether relative prices of vehicles with different fuel economy ratings fully adjust to variation in gasoline prices. Vehicle prices move as if consumers are indifferent between $1.00 in discounted future gas cost and $0.76 in vehicle purchase price. We show how corrections for endogenous market shares and utilization, measurement error, and different gasoline price forecasts affect the results. We also provide unique evidence of sticky information: vehicle markets respond to changes in gasoline prices with up to a six-month delay.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Using two strategies, we show that consumers underreact to taxes that are not salient. First, using a field experiment in a grocery store, we find that posting tax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent. Second, increases in taxes included in posted prices reduce alcohol consumption more than increases in taxes applied at the register. We develop a theoretical framework for applied welfare analysis that accommodates salience effects and other optimization failures. The simple formulas we derive imply that the economic incidence of a tax depends on its statutory incidence, and that even policies that induce no change in behavior can create efficiency losses.

TI  - Investment in financial literacy and saving decisions
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract We present an intertemporal consumption model of investment in financial literacy. Consumers benefit from such investment because financial literacy allows them to increase the returns on wealth. Since literacy depreciates over time and has a cost in terms of current consumption, the model delivers an optimal investment in literacy. Furthermore, literacy and wealth are determined jointly, and are positively correlated over the life-cycle. The model drives our empirical approach to the analysis of the effect of financial literacy on wealth and saving and indicates that the stock of financial literacy early in life is a valid instrument in the regression of wealth on financial literacy. Using microeconomic and aggregate data, we find strong support for the model’s predictions.

TI  - SHROUDED ATTRIBUTES, CONSUMER MYOPIA, AND INFORMATION SUPPRESSION IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
PY  - 2006
AB  - Bayesian consumers infer that hidden add-on prices (e.g., the cost of ink for a printer) are likely to be high prices. If consumers are Bayesian, firms will not shroud information in equilibrium. However, shrouding may occur in an economy with some myopic (or unaware) consumers. Such shrouding creates an inefficiency, which firms may have an incentive to eliminate by educating their competitors' customers. However, if add-ons have close substitutes, a "curse of debiasing" arises, and firms will not be able to profitably debias consumers by unshrouding add-ons. In equilibrium, two kinds of exploitation coexist. Optimizing firms exploit myopic consumers through marketing schemes that shroud high-priced add-ons. In turn, sophisticated consumers exploit these marketing schemes. It is not possible to profitably drive away the business of sophisticates. It is also not possible to profitably lure either myopes or sophisticates to nonexploitative firms. We show that informational shrouding flourishes even in highly competitive markets, even in markets with costless advertising, and even when the shrouding generates allocational inefficiencies.

TI  - Transient and Persistent Energy Efficiency in the US Residential Sector: Evidence from Household-level Data
PY  - 2017
AB  - In this paper, we measure the energy efficiency implicit in residential energy consumption using a panel dataset comprised of 40,246 observations from US households observed over 1997–2009. We fit a stochastic frontier model of the minimum input of energy needed to meet the level of energy services demanded by the household. This benchmarking exercise produces a transient and a persistent efficiency index for each household and each time period. We estimate that the US residential sector could save approximately 10% of its total energy consumption if it reduced persistent inefficiencies and 17% if it were possible to eliminate transient inefficiencies. These figures are in line with recent economy-wide assessments for the USA. Our results suggest that savings in energy use and associated emissions of greenhouse gases may benefit from both policy measures that attain short-run behavioral changes (e.g., nudges, social norms, display of real-time information about usage, and real-time pricing) as well measures aimed at the long run, such as energy-efficiency regulations, incentives on the purchase of high-efficiency equipment, and incentives towards a change of habits in the use of the equipment.

TI  - Discounting financial literacy: Time preferences and participation in financial education programs
PY  - 2013
AB  - Many policymakers and economists argue that financial literacy is key to financial well-being. But why do many individuals remain financially illiterate despite the benefits of being financially informed?

This paper presents results from a field study linking individual decisions to acquire financial information to a normally unobservable characteristic: time preferences. We elicited time preferences using incentivized choice experiments for all individuals to whom a financial education program was offered. Our results show that individuals who choose to acquire personal financial information have substantially higher discount factors than individuals who do not. The results can be interpreted as non-participants discount the benefits of being financially literate more.

TI  - Behavioral Economics and Energy Conservation – A Systematic Review of Non-price Interventions and Their Causal Effects
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Research from economics and psychology suggests that behavioral interventions can be a powerful climate policy instrument. This paper provides a systematic review of the existing empirical evidence on non-price interventions targeting energy conservation behavior of private households. Specifically, we analyze four nudge-like interventions referred to as social comparison, commitment devices, goal setting, and labeling in 44 international studies comprising 105 treatments. This paper differs from previous systematic reviews by solely focusing on studies that permit the identification of causal effects. We find that all four interventions have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption of private households, yet effect sizes vary immensely. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of impact evaluations before rolling out behavioral policy interventions at scale.

TI  - Establishing Measurement Criteria for an Energy Literacy Questionnaire
PY  - 2013
AB  - Energy literacy is a broad term encompassing content knowledge as well as a citizenship understanding of energy that includes affective and behavioral aspects. This article presents explicit criteria that will serve as a foundation for developing measurable objectives for energy literacy in three dimensions: cognitive (knowledge, cognitive skills), affective (attitude, values, personal responsibility); and behavioral. The outcome of this research is a framework from which a quantitative survey of energy literacy for secondary students in New York State, United States, can be created. Efforts supported by this research may help assess the broader impacts of educational programs in terms of their effectiveness for improving students’ energy literacy.

TI  - Information v. Energy Efficiency Incentives: Evidence from Residential Electricity Consumption in Maryland
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract We focus on two utility programs intended to reduce energy usage and the associated CO2 emissions—a home energy audit and rebates on the purchase of high-efficiency air-source heat pumps. We use a unique panel dataset from participating and non-participating households to estimate the average treatment effect of participating in either program on electricity usage. We fit models with household-by-season, season-by-year, and household-by-year fixed effects to account for all possible confounders that might influence energy usage. Since the programs are voluntary, we seek to restore near-exogeneity of the program “treatment” by matching participating households with control households. We deploy coarsened exact matching (CEM; Iacus et al., 2011) as our main matching method. We ask whether it is sufficient to match households based on past electricity usage, or if we gain by adding structural characteristics of the home, including heating system type. We find that the two programs reduce electricity usage by 5% on average. The effects are strong in both winter and summer for the energy audit groups but appear to be stronger in the winter for the heat pump rebate group. Adding house characteristics to the matching variables does seem to affect results, suggesting that using past usage alone, or house characteristics alone, may not be sufficient to identify the effects of program participation.

TI  - Measuring electric energy efficiency in Portuguese households
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose – There is a great interest from the European Union in measuring the efficiency of energy use in households, and this is an area where EDP has done research in both data collection and methodology. This paper reports on a survey of electric energy use in Portuguese households, and reviews and extends the analysis of how efficiently households use electrical energy. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate household electrical energy efficiency in different regions using econometric analysis of the survey data. In addition, the same methodology was applied to a time-series data set, to evaluate recent developments in energy efficiency. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes the application to Portuguese households of a new approach to evaluate energy efficiency, developed by Filippini and Hunt (2011, 2012) in which an econometric energy demand model was estimated to control for exogenous variables determining energy demand. The variation in energy efficiency over time and space could the...

TI  - Internal and external barriers to energy efficiency: which role for policy interventions?
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper reviews the empirical literature that provides a correlation between the different barriers to energy efficiency and consumer behavior related to two domains. It evaluates behavior related to energy curtailment, which represents routine, repetitive effort to decrease consumption on a day-to-day basis. It also considers behavior related to investments, which are one time actions such as purchasing new energy efficiency technologies. The paper also reviews the existing literature that assesses the effect of policies on energy use and investment in energy efficiency technologies. By surveying the relevant research, this paper has two objectives. First, it discusses the impact of different barriers on energy efficiency, and second, it combines policy interventions with barriers related to both energy use and investment in energy efficiency technologies.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the application of behavioral public economics to energy efficiency. I document policy makers' arguments for “paternalistic” energy efficiency policies, formalize with a simple model of misoptimizing consumers, review and critique empirical evidence, and suggest future research directions. Although empirical results suggest that policies to address imperfect information and internalities may increase welfare in some cases, some existing policies may be mistargeted or miscalibrated.

TI  - Performance in Competitive Environments: Gender Differences
PY  - 2003
AB  - Even though the provision of equal opportunities for men and women has been a priority in many countries, large gender differences prevail in competitive high-ranking positions. Suggested explanations include discrimination and differences in preferences and human capital. In this paper we present experimental evidence in support of an additional factor: women may be less effective than men in competitive environments, even if they are able to perform similarly in non-competitive environments. In a laboratory experiment we observe, as we increase the competitiveness of the environment, a significant increase in performance for men, but not for women. This results in a significant gender gap in performance in tournaments, while there is no gap when participants are paid according to piece rate. This effect is stronger when women have to compete against men than in single-sex competitive environments: this suggests that women may be able to perform in competitive environments per se.

TI  - Consumer Inattention, Heuristic Thinking and the Role of Energy Labels
PY  - 2017
AB  - Energy labels have been introduced in many countries to increase consumers' attention to energy use in purchase decisions of durables. In a discrete-choice experiment among about 5,000 households, we implement randomized information treatments to explore how energy labels influence purchasing decisions. Our results show that adding annual operating cost information to the EU energy label promotes the choice of energy-efficient durables. In addition, we find that a majority of participants value efficiency classes beyond the economic value of the underlying energy use differences. Our results further indicate that displaying operating cost affects choices through two distinct channels: it increases the attention to operating cost and reduces the valuation of efficiency class differences.

AB  - We investigate the use of standard statistical models for quantal choice in a game theoretic setting. Players choose strategies based on relative expected utility and assume other players do so as well. We define a quantal response equilibrium (ORE) as a fixed point of this process and establish existence. For a logit specification of the error structure, we show that as the error goes to zero, QRE approaches a subset of Nash equilibria and also implies a unique selection from the set of Nash equilibria in generic games. We fit the model to a variety of experimental data sets by using maximum likelihood estimation. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: C19, C44, C72, C92.

TI  - Partners contribute more to Public Goods than Strangers: Conditional Cooperation
PY  - 1997
AB  - In a series of experiments, we compare a situation where the same group of four subjects plays 25 repetitions of a public good game (partners condition) to a situation where subjects play this game in changing group formations over 25 periods (strangers condition). We observe that, on aggregate over all periods, subjects in the partners condition contribute significantly more to the public good than subjects in the strangers condition. This difference is significant already in the first period. In the strangers condition, contributions show a continual decay, while in the partners condition, contributionsfluctuate on a relatively high level until they drastically decrease in the final periods. Our tentative explanation is that subjects' behavior in the public good situation represents conditional cooperation, characterized by both future-oriented and simple reactive behavior. With this interpretation, we are able to explain the observed differences between the twoconditions.

TI  - On expectations and the monetary stakes in ultimatum games
PY  - 2000
AB  - In an ultimatum game, player 1 makes an offer of $X from a total of $M to player 2. If player 2 accepts the offer, then player 1 is paid $(M-X) and player 2 receives $X; if player 2 rejects the offer, each gets zero. In the ultimatum game experiments reported in the literature,M is typically not more than $10 (see Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin and Sefton, 1994, hereafter FHSS; Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat and Smith, 1994, hereafter HMSS, and the literature cited therein). We report new results for 50 bargaining pairs in whichM=$100, and compare them with previous outcomes from 48 pairs withM=$10. The need for an examination of the effect of increased stakes on ultimatum bargaining is suggested by a literature survey of the effect of varying the stakes in a wide variety of decision making and market experiments over the last 33 years (Smith and Walker, 1993b). Many cases were found in which the predictions of theory were improved when the monetary rewards were increased. There were also cases in which the level of monetary rewards had no effect on the results. Consequently, it is necessary to examine the stakes question on a case by case basis. The previously reported effect of instructional changes, which define different institutional contexts, on ultimatum game outcomes, and the effect of stakes reported here, suggest a game formulation that explains changes in the behavior of both players as a result of changes in the instructional treatments. We formulate such a model and indicate how it might be further tested.

TI  - A Theory of Social Comparison Processes
PY  - 1954
AB  - Hypothesis I: There exists, in the human organism, a drive to evaluate his opinions and his abilities. While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities. It is consequently

TI  - An Experimental Study of Competitive Market Behavior
PY  - 1962
AB  - INTRODUCTION RECENT years have witnessed a growing interest in experimental L. games such as management decision- making games and games designed to simulate oligopolistic market phenomena. This article reports on a series of experimental games designed to study some of the hypotheses of neoclassical competitive market theory. Since the organized stock, bond, and commodity exchanges would seem to have the best chance of fulfilling the conditions of an operational theory of supply and demand, most of these experiments have been designed to simulate, on a modest scale, the multilateral auction-trading process characteristic of these organized markets. I would emphasize, however, that they are intended as simulations of certain key features of the organized markets and of competitive markets generally, rather than as direct, exhaustive simulations of any particular organized exchange. The experimental conditions of supply and demand in force in these markets are modeled closely upon the supply and demand curves generated by the limit price orders in the hands of stock and commodity market brokers at the opening of a trading day in any one stock or commodity, though I would consider them to be good general models of received short-run supply and demand theory. A similar experimental supply and demand model was first used by E. H. Chamberlin in an interesting set of experiments that pre-date contemporary interest in experimental games.

TI  - A Theory of Sequential Reciprocity
PY  - 1998
AB  - Many experimental studies indicate that people are motivated by reciprocity. Rabin (1993) develops techniques for incorporating such concerns into game theory and economics. His model, however, does not fare well when applied to situations with an interesting dynamic structure (like many experimental games), because it is developed for normal form games in which information about the sequential structure of a strategic situation is suppressed.In this paper we develop a theory of reciprocity for extensive games in which the sequential structure of a strategic situation is made explicit. We propose a new solution concept-sequential reciprocity equilibrium-which is applicable to extensive games, and we prove a general equilibrium existence result. The model is applied in several examples, including some well known experimental games like the Ultimatum game and the Sequential Prisoners' Dilemma.

TI  - Learning in Extensive-Form Games: Experimental Data and Simple Dynamic Models in the Intermediate Term*
PY  - 1995
AB  - We use simple learning models to track the behavior observed in experiments concerning three extensive form games with similar perfect equilibria. In only two of the games does observed behavior approach the perfect equilibrium as players gain experience. We examine a family of learning models which possess some of the robust properties of learning noted in the psychology literature. The intermediate term predictions of these models track well the observed behavior in all three games, even though the models considered differ in their very long term predictions. We argue that for predicting observed behavior the intermediate term predictions of dynamic learning models may be even more important than their asymptotic properties.

TI  - Fairness: Effect on Temporary and Equilibrium Prices in Posted Offer Markets
PY  - 1995
AB  - Questionnaire studies suggest that perceptions of fairness cause people to resist price increases following abrupt changes in conditions with no cost justification. This hypothesis is examined in posted-offer markets extending previous work. Consistent with the hypothesis, in the profit-disclosure (fairness) treatment prices are initially below those in the cost and the no-disclosure treatments. But over time prices in all treatments converge to the competitive surplus maximizing equilibrium. Thus 'fairness' is interpreted as being the result of expectations that are not sustainable. Expectations adapt as the market converges to the standard competitive equilibrium prediction. Coauthors are Praveen Kujal, Roland Michelitsch, Vernon Smith, and Gang Deng.

TI  - Wage Rigidity in a Competitive Incomplete Contract Market
PY  - 1999
AB  - Do employers and workers underbid prevailing wages if there si unemployment? Do employers take advantage of workers' underbidding by lowering wages? Do employers take advantage of workers underbidding by lowering wages? We hypothesize that under conditions of incomplete labor contracts, wage levels may positively affect workers' propensity to cooperate. This, in turn, may prevent firms from underbidding or accepting the underbidding of workers. Experimental double auctions conducted for the purpose of examinating these hypotheses yield the following results: (i) Workers' underbidding is very frequent, but employers refuse to accept workers' low wage offers in markets with complete labor contracts, employes accept and actively enforce wages close to the competitive level. (ii) Workers' effort is positively related to the wage level. Therefore over their effort level. This holds true even in the presence of explicit performance incentives.

TI  - Satisfaction and comparison income
PY  - 1996
AB  - Abstract This paper attempts to test the hypothesis that utility depends on income relative to a ‘comparison’ or reference level. Using data on 5,000 British workers, it provides two findings. First, workers' reported satisfaction levels are shown to be inversely related to their comparison wage rates. Second, holding income constant, satisfaction levels are shown to be strongly declining in the level of education. More generally, the paper tries to help begin the task of constructing an economics of job satisfaction.

TI  - Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice: A Reference-Dependent Model
PY  - 1991
AB  - Much experimental evidence indicates that choice depends on the status quo or reference level: changes of reference point often lead to reversals of preference. We present a reference-dependent theory of consumer choice, which explains such effects by a deformation of indifference curves about the reference point. The central assumption of the theory is that losses and disadvantages have greater impact on preferences than gains and advantages. Implications of loss aversion for economic behavior are considered. The standard models of decision making assume that preferences do not depend on current assets. This assumption greatly simplifies the analysis of individual choice and the prediction of trades: indifference curves are drawn without reference to current holdings, and the Coase theorem asserts that, except for transaction costs, initial entitlements do not affect final allocations. The facts of the matter are more complex. There is substantial evidence that initial entitlements do matter and that the rate of exchange between goods can be quite different depending on which is acquired and which is given up, even in the absence of transaction costs or income effects. In accord with a psychological analysis of value, reference levels play a large role in determining preferences. In the present paper we review the evidence for this proposition and offer a theory that generalizes the standard model by introducing a reference state. The present analysis of riskless choice extends our treatment of choice under uncertainty [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, 1984; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991], in which the outcomes of risky prospects are evaluated by a value function that has three essential characteristics. Reference dependence: the carriers of value are gains and losses defined relative to a reference point. Loss aversion: the function is steeper in the negative than in the positive domain; losses loom larger than corresponding gains. Diminishing sensitivity: the marginal value of both gains and losses decreases with their

TI  - A Shred of Evidence on Theories of Wage Stickiness
PY  - 1989
AB  - A small interview survey was undertaken to see how actual wage-setters would react to the central. ideas of several economic theories of wage stickiness. Wage cuts were surprisingly prevalent in recent years, despite the booming economy. The strongest finding was that managers believe that perceptions of fairness play a major motivational role in labor markets; and that a "fair" wage policy is a good deal more complicated than simply not cutting wages. We also found substantial evidence for money illusion and against the adverse-selection version of the efficiency wage model.

TI  - Warm-Glow versus Cold-Prickle: The Effects of Positive and Negative Framing on Cooperation in Experiments
PY  - 1995
AB  - Experiments on privately provided public goods generally find that subjects are far more cooperative than predicted, while experiments on oligopolies and the commons almost always obtain the Nash-equilibrium predictions, despite being very similar games. This paper examines whether this difference could be due to the fact that with public goods there is a positive externality, while with the others the externality is negative. The result of the experiments is that subjects are more willing to cooperate when the externality is positive, even though the potential outcomes are the same. This suggests a behavioral asymmetry between the warm-glow of doing something good and cold-prickle of doing something bad.

TI  - Social Utility and Decision Making in Interpersonal Contexts
PY  - 1989
AB  - Three studies examined preferences for outcomes to self and a codisputant. Studies I and 2 estimated social utility functions from judgments of satisfaction with alternative outcomes. Comparing functional forms, we found that a utility function, including terms for own payoff and for positive and negative discrepancies between the parties' payoffs (advantageous and disadvantageous inequality), provides a close fit to the data. The typical utility function is steeply increasing and convex for disadvantageous inequality and weakly declining and convex for advantageous inequality. We manipulated dispute type (personal, business) and disputant relationship (positive, neutral, or negative) and found that both strongly influence preferences for advantageous but not disadvantageous inequality. A third study contrasted implications of the social utility functions with predictions of individual utility theories. People care about the outcomes of others. We sacrifice our own interests to help loved ones or harm adversaries. Participants withdraw from profitable participation in a laboratory experiment if they perceive inequity in remuneration (Schmitt & Marweli, 1972). Players in two-person ultimatum games (in which one player proposes a distribution of a fixed amount of money that the other has the option of either accepting or rejecting) frequently reject a positive but inequitable offer even though the alternative is no gain at all (Guth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze, 1982). Negotiations between parties often collapse when one party becomes incensed with the other and attempts to "maximize his opponent's displeasure rather than his own satisfaction" (scigel & Fouraker, 1960, p. 100). In general, disputants are concerned not only with the outcomes they receive, but also with the outcomes of their opponents (Pruitt & Rubin, 1986).

TI  - Cooperation in the One-shot Prisoner's Dilemma Based on Expectations of Reciprocity
PY  - 1996
AB  - By applying the“illusion of control”hypothesis (Karp et al., 1993), originally developed to explain ingroup favoritism in the minimal group experiments, to a prisoner's dilemma (PD) situation, we predicted that the cooperation rate of players would be affected by their illusion of control. We used a sequential PD in which one player decides before the other does to maximize and minimize feasibility of illusion of control. Specifically, the following three hypotheses were successfully tested. Hypothesis 1: The decision of the second player in a sequential PD would be affected by the choice of the first player, cooperating with the cooperative first player and defecting with the defective first player. Hypothesis 2: Compared to the players of ordinary simultaneous one-shot PD (simultaneous condition), the player who decides first and whose decision is informed to the second player before the latter makes his/her decision would feel controllability over the second player and thus would cooperate more. Hypothesis 3: Compared to the simltaneous condition, players uwould cooperate less when they know (without being informed of the first player's choice) that the first player has already made his/her decision. The second experiment was conducted to replicate Hypothesis 3, the most important hypothesis of the three. The hypothesis was also supported in the second experiment.

TI  - Choosing the Wrong Pond: Social Comparisons in Negotiations That Reflect a Self-Serving Bias
PY  - 1996
AB  - We explore the role that choice of comparison groups plays in explaining impasse in teacher contract negotiations. We hypothesize that the negotiators select "comparable" districts in a biased fashion such that teachers' salaries in districts that unions view as comparable are higher than teachers' salaries in districts that school boards view as comparable. We also predict that strike activity is positively related to the difference in the salary levels of the unions' and boards' lists of comparables. We test these predictions using a unique combination of subjective survey and field data on teacher contract negotiations in Pennsylvania. Both hypotheses are supported by the data.

TI  - Theories of Pay and Unemployment: Survey Evidence from Swedish Manufacturing Firms*
PY  - 1995
AB  - An interview survey was designed to explore how personnel managers and senior wage negotiators respond to popular models of the labor market. As in Blinder and Choi (1990), our results indicate that relative wages and notions of fairness are important, and that this may explain nominal wage rigidity. We find much evidence of efficiency wage mechanisms. The reactions to some questions also point to theories based on rent-sharing. Moreover, while underbidding is not that uncommon, firms seem quite unwilling to hire underbidders. We also obtain indications of adverse selection problems.

AB  - Community standards of fairness for the setting of prices and wages were elicited by telephone surveys. In customer or labor markets it isacceptable for a firm to raise prices (or cut wages) when profits arethreatened, and to maintain prices when costs diminish. It is unfair toexploit shifts in demand by raising prices or cutting wages. Several market anomalies are explained by assuming that these standards of fairness influence the behavior of firms.

PY  - 1998
AB  - A reciprocal action is an action meant to have a similar influence on another's payoff as another's action has on one's own. One hypothesis asserts that reciprocal action is triggered by the reciprocator's belief that another's action was good or ill intended. The other hypothesis says that the reciprocator is simply acting to implement fixed preferences over payoff allocations. We report on an experiment that allows us to study both positive (reward) and negative (punishment) reciprocal action in a single framework. Knowing the preferences for payoff allocations is sufficient to account for nearly all the reciprocal action we observe in our experiment.

The many factors interact with each other in unknown ways. Nothing is known for sure.

TI  - Decision Making: THE RELEVANCE OF QUASI RATIONALITY IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
PY  - 1988
AB  - Economists generally attribute considerable rationality to the agents in their models. The recent popularity of rational expectations models is more an example of a general tendency than a radical departure. Since rationality is simply assumed, there is little in the literature to suggest what would happen if some agents were not rational. This is surprising in light of the accumulating evidence that supports Herbert Simon's view that man should be considered at most boundedly rational. In fact, Kenneth Arrow concludes his recent review of this evidence as follows: "I hope to have made a case for the proposition that an important class of intertemporal markets shows systematic deviations from individual rational behavior and that these deviations are consistent with evidence from very different sources... (1982, p. 8). In this paper we start to explore the implications of irrationality for economics. We begin by defining what we mean by rational, and what departures from rationality we think are most likely. We then consider what happens if rational and less than fully rational agents (whom we call quasi rational) interact in competitive markets. We show that the knee-jerk reaction of some economists that competition will render irrationality irrelevant is apt only in very special cases, probably rarely observed in the real world. Our analysis highlights the important roles played by arbitrageurs and entrepreneurs. We find that, perhaps counter to intuition, more competition can actually make things worse by leaving no possibility of a profit to an entrepreneur who offers education or information.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract We use mutual fund flows as a measure of individual investor sentiment for different stocks, and find that high sentiment predicts low future returns. Fund flows are dumb money–by reallocating across different mutual funds, retail investors reduce their wealth in the long run. This dumb money effect is related to the value effect: high sentiment stocks tend to be growth stocks. High sentiment also is associated with high corporate issuance, interpretable as companies increasing the supply of shares in response to investor demand.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Investors who follow different tenets of social responsibility and choose different socially responsible mutual funds might be described as members of different religious denominations. Some social responsibility “religions” have a single tenet, such as protection of the environment. Others combine several, such as avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, and weapons-making. A framework of the economics of religion can help us answer questions such as why some mutual funds attract many investors while others attract few; the differences between strategies that are effective at attracting individual versus institutional investors to SRI; and whether government regulations aimed at fostering SRI are likely to accomplish their aim.

TI  - Does Stock Return Momentum Explain the “Smart Money” Effect?
PY  - 2004
AB  - Does the "smart money" effect documented by Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999) reflect fund selection ability of mutual fund investors? We examine the finding that investors are able to predict mutual fund performance and invest accordingly. We show that the smart money effect is explained by the stock return momentum phenomenon documented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). Further evidence suggests investors do not select funds based on a momentum investing style, but rather simply chase funds that were recent winners. Our finding that a common factor in stock returns explains the smart money effect offers no affirmation of investor fund selection ability. Do INVESTORS MAKE SMART CHOICES when selecting mutual funds? Studies by Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999) suggest that investors have selection ability, a finding that has been dubbed the "smart money" effect. Using a sample of 227 stock mutual funds during the period 1985-1994, Gruber (1996) shows that the risk-adjusted return on new cash flows to funds is higher than the average return for all investors in the funds. Subsequent work by Zheng (1999) analyzes a sample of 1,826 stock mutual funds during the period 1970-1993 and also finds that the short-term performance of funds that experience positive new money flow is significantly better than those that experience negative new money flow. One possible explanation for the smart money effect is that investors base their investment decisions on fund-specific information, or in other words, they have an ability to identify superior managers and invest accordingly. An important implication of such an interpretation is that it provides a rationale for investing in actively managed mutual funds, as argued by Gruber (1996).1 This is not, however, the only plausible explanation for the smart money effect. In particular, we note that in benchmarking fund performance neither Gruber nor Zheng accounts for the well-known Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) stock return

TI  - Mutual Fund Flows and Performance in Rational Markets
PY  - 2002
AB  - We derive a parsimonious rational model of active portfolio management that reproduces many regularities widely regarded as anomalous. Fund flows rationally respond to past performance in the model even though performance is not persistent and investments with active managers do not outperform passive benchmarks on average. The lack of persistence in returns does not imply that differential ability across managers is nonexistent or unrewarded or that gathering information about performance is socially wasteful. The model can quantitatively reproduce many salient features in the data. The flow-performance relationship is consistent with high average levels of skills and considerable heterogeneity across managers.

TI  - The Eco-Efficiency Premium Puzzle
PY  - 2005
AB  - Does socially responsible investing (SRI) lead to inferior or superior portfolio performance? This study focused on the concept of “eco-efficiency,” which can be thought of as the economic value a company creates relative to the waste it generates, and found that SRI produced superior performance. Based on Innovest Strategic Value Advisors' corporate eco-efficiency scores, the study constructed and evaluated two equity portfolios that differed in eco-efficiency. The high-ranked portfolio provided substantially higher average returns than its low-ranked counterpart over the 1995–2003 period. This performance differential could not be explained by differences in market sensitivity, investment style, or industry-specific factors. Moreover, the results remained significant for all levels of transaction costs, suggesting that the incremental benefits of SRI can be substantial.

TI  - Does Fund Size Erode Mutual Fund Performance? The Role of Liquidity and Organization
PY  - 2004
AB  - We investigate the effect of scale on performance in the active money management industry. We first document that fund returns, both before and after fees and expenses, decline with lagged fund size, even after accounting for various performance benchmarks. We then explore a number of potential explanations for this relationship. This association is most pronounced among funds that have to invest in small and illiquid stocks, suggesting that these adverse scale effects are related to liquidity. Controlling for its size, a fund's return does not deteriorate with the size of the family that it belongs to, indicating that scale need not be bad for performance depending on how the fund is organized. Finally, using data on whether funds are solo-managed or team-managed and the composition of fund investments, we explore the idea that scale erodes fund performance because of the interaction of liquidity and organizational diseconomies.

TI  - Governance Mechanisms and Equity Prices
PY  - 2005
AB  - We investigate how the market for corporate control (external governance) and shareholder activism (internal governance) interact. A portfolio that buys firms with the highest level of takeover vulnerability and shorts firms with the lowest level of takeover vulnerability generates an annualized abnormal return of 10% to 15% only when public pension fund (blockholder) ownership is high as well. A similar portfolio created to capture the importance of internal governance generates annualized abnormal returns of 8%, though only in the presence of “high” vulnerability to takeovers. The complementarity effect exists for firms with lower industry-adjusted leverage and is stronger for smaller firms.

TI  - Does the Stock Market Fully Value Intangibles? Employee Satisfaction and Equity Prices
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes the relationship between employee satisfaction and long-run stock returns. A value-weighted portfolio of the “100 Best Companies to Work For in America” earned an annual four-factor alpha of 3.5% from 1984 to 2009, and 2.1% above industry benchmarks. The results are robust to controls for firm characteristics, different weighting methodologies, and the removal of outliers. The Best Companies also exhibited significantly more positive earnings surprises and announcement returns. These findings have three main implications. First, consistent with human capital-centered theories of the firm, employee satisfaction is positively correlated with shareholder returns and need not represent managerial slack. Second, the stock market does not fully value intangibles, even when independently verified by a highly public survey on large firms. Third, certain socially responsible investing (SRI) screens may improve investment returns.

TI  - Behaviorial Finance: Past Battles and Future Engagements
PY  - 1999
AB  - Market efficiency is at the center of the battle of standard finance versus behavioral finance versus investment professionals. But the battle is not joined because the term “market efficiency” has two meanings. One meaning is that investors cannot systematically beat the market. The other is that security prices are rational. Rational prices reflect only utilitarian characteristics, such as risk, not value-expressive characteristics, such as sentiment. Behavioral finance has shown, however, that value-expressive characteristics matter in both investor choices and asset prices. Therefore, the discipline of finance would do well to accept the first meaning of market efficiency and reject the notion that security prices are rational. We could then stop fighting the market efficiency battle and focus on exploring (1) asset-pricing models that reflect both value-expressive and utilitarian characteristics and (2) the benefits, both utilitarian and value expressive, that investment professionals provide to inve...

TI  - DOES PRIOR PERFORMANCE AFFECT A MUTUAL FUND'S CHOICE OF RISK? THEORY AND FURTHER EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE *
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recent empirical studies of mutual fund competition examine the relation between a fund's performance, the fund manager's compensation, and the fund manager's choice of portfolio risk. This paper models a manager's portfolio choice for compensation rules that can be either a concave, linear, or convex function of the fund's performance relative to that of a benchmark. For particular compensation structures, a manager increases the fund's "tracking error" volatility as its relative performance declines. However, declining performance does not necessarily lead the manager to raise the volatility of the fund's return. The paper presents nonparametric and parametric tests of the relation between mutual fund performance and risk taking for more than 6,000 equity mutual funds over the 1962 to 2006 period. There is a tendency for mutual funds to increase the standard deviation of tracking errors, but not the standard deviation of returns, as their performance declines. This riskshifting behavior appears more common for funds whose managers have longer tenures. I. Introduction As mutual fund investing has grown, the management of mutual funds has come under closer scrutiny by financial economists. One strand of research examines potential agency problems between a mutual fund's shareholders and its portfolio manager. Several studies investigate whether a manager might unnecessarily shift the fund's risk in response to changes in its performance relative to other funds. This behavior is linked to the way the manager is compensated and to the actions of mutual fund investors. The manager's compensation depends on her success in generating flows of new investments into the fund, while mutual fund investors "chase returns" by channeling investments into funds with better

PY  - 2011
AB  - We investigate the differences in economic attitudes and financial decisions between religious and non-religious households. Using Dutch survey data, we find that religious households consider themselves more trusting, and have a stronger bequest motive and a longer planning horizon. Furthermore, Catholics attach more importance to thrift and are more risk averse, while Protestants combine a more external locus of control with a greater sense of financial responsibility. Religious households are more likely to save. Catholic households invest less frequently in the stock market. Economic attitudes are particularly helpful in explaining the financial decisions of Catholic households.

Investors were surveyed to assess the relative importance of financial versus ecological considerations. Demographic and investor behavior attributes of ESL shareholders were compared with those of Australian shareholders as reported by an Australian Stock Exchange survey. The results showed that the environmental mission of ESL took pre-eminence over financial considerations for these investors. Comparison of the two groups revealed significant differences in most variables.

AB  - This article reports a unique analysis of private engagements by an activist fund. It is based on data made available to us by Hermes, the fund manager owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, on engagements with management in companies targeted by its UK Focus Fund. In contrast with most previous studies of activism, we report that the fund executes shareholder activism predominantly through private interventions that would be unobservable in studies purely relying on public information. The fund substantially outperforms benchmarks and we estimate that abnormal returns are largely associated with engagements rather than stock picking.

TI  - On Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance
PY  - 1997
AB  - Using a sample free of survivor bias, I demonstrate that common factors in stock returns and investment expenses almost completely explain persistence in equity mutual funds' mean and risk-adjusted returns. Hendricks, Patel and Zeckhauser's (1993) "hot hands" result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers. PERSISTENCE IN MUTUAL FUND performance does not reflect superior stock-picking skill. Rather, common factors in stock returns and persistent differences in mutual fund expenses and transaction costs explain almost all of the predictability in mutual fund returns. Only the strong, persistent underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds remains anomalous. Mutual fund persistence is well documented in the finance literature, but not well explained. Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993), Goetzmann and Ibbotson (1994), Brown and Goetzmann (1995), and Wermers (1996) find evidence of persistence in mutual fund performance over short-term horizons of one to three years, and attribute the persistence to "hot hands" or common investment strategies. Grinblatt and Titman (1992), Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (1993), and Elton, Gruber, Das, and Blake (1996) document mutual fund return predictability over longer horizons of five to ten years, and attribute this to manager differential information or stock-picking talent. Contrary evidence comes from Jensen (1969), who does not find that good subsequent performance follows good past performance. Carhart (1992) shows that persistence in expense ratios drives much of the long-term persistence in mutual fund performance. My analysis indicates that Jegadeesh and Titman's (1993) one-year momentum in stock returns accounts for Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser's (1993) hot hands effect in mutual fund performance. However, funds that earn higher

TI  - Out of Sight, Out of Mind: The Effects of Expenses on Mutual Fund Flows*
PY  - 2005
AB  - We argue that the purchase decisions of mutual fund investors are influenced by salient, attention‐grabbing information. Investors are more sensitive to salient, in‐your‐face fees, like front‐end loads and commissions, than operating expenses; they buy funds that attract their attention through exceptional performance, marketing, or advertising. We analyze mutual fund flows over the last 30 years and find negative relations between flows and front‐end‐load fees. In contrast, we find no relation between operating expenses and flows. Additional analyses indicate that marketing and advertising, the costs of which are often embedded in funds' operating expenses, account for this surprising result.

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors. related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates. the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important. the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.

AB  - Morally motivated individuals behave more cooperatively than predicted by standard theory. Hence, if a firm can attract workers who are strongly motivated by ethical concerns, moral hazard problems like shirking can be reduced. We show that employers may be able to use the firm's corporate social responsibility profile as a screening device to attract more productive workers. Both pooling and separating equilibria are possible. Even when a substantial share of the workers have no moral motivation whatsoever, such screening may in fact drive every firm with a low social responsibility profile out of business.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Using a new data set of accounting information merged with share price data, we found a strong value premium in the United Kingdom for the period 1955–2001. It existed among small-capitalization and large-capitalization stocks. But small-cap stock managers who wish to capture the higher expected returns face some challenges. We show that rebalancing-induced portfolio turnover for indexed small-cap value strategies can be substantial. Coupled with the relative illiquidity of the U.K. market for small-cap value stocks, such high turnover calls for strategies that sacrifice tracking accuracy in favor of reducing trading needs and lowering trading costs.

PY  - 1998
AB  - This paper studies the flows of funds into and out of equity mutual funds. Consumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to be an important determinant of fund flows. High performance appears to be most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower consumers' search costs.

TI  - Estimating Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches
PY  - 2008
AB  - In both corporate finance and asset pricing empirical work, researchers are often confronted with panel data. In these data sets, the residuals may be correlated across firms and across time, and OLS standard errors can be biased. Historically, the two literatures have used different solutions to this problem. Corporate finance has relied on clustered standard errors, while asset pricing has used the Fama-MacBeth procedure to estimate standard errors. This paper examines the different methods used in the literature and explains when the different methods yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge. The intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their use.

The question remains as to why mutual funds and in particular actively managed mutual funds have grown so fast, when their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. One possible explanation of why investors buy actively managed open end funds lies in the fact that they are bought and sold at net asset value, and thus management ability may not be priced. If management ability exists and it is not included in the price of open end funds, then performance should be predictable. If performance is predictable and at least some investors are aware of this, then cash flows into and out of funds should be predictable by the very same metrics that predict performance. Finally, if predictors exist and at least some investors act on these predictors in investing in mutual funds, the return on new cash flows should be better than the average return for all investors in these funds. This article presents empirical evidence on all of these issues and shows that investors in actively managed mutual funds may have been more rational than we have assumed.

TI  - International Evidence on Ethical Mutual Fund Performance and Investment Style
PY  - 2005
AB  - Using an international database containing 103 German, UK and US ethical mutual funds we review and extend previous research on ethical mutual fund performance. By applying a Carhart multi-factor model [Carhart, Journal of Finance 57 (1997) 57] we overcome the benchmark problem most prior ethical studies suffered from. After controlling for investment style, we find no evidence of significant differences in risk-adjusted returns between ethical and conventional funds for the 1990–2001 period. Our results also suggest that ethical mutual funds underwent a catching up phase, before delivering financial returns similar to those of conventional mutual funds. Finally, our performance estimates are robust to the inclusion of ethical indexes, which, surprisingly, are not incrementally capable of explaining ethical mutual fund return variation.

TI  - Family Values and the Star Phenomenon: Strategies of Mutual Fund Families
PY  - 2004
AB  - We examine the extent to which a fund's cash flows are affected by the stellar performance of other funds in its family -- and consequences of such spillovers. We show that star performance results in greater cash inflow to the fund and to other funds in its family. Moreover, families with higher variation in investment strategies across funds are shown to be more likely to generate star performance. We argue that spillovers may induce lower ability families to pursue star-creating strategies. Consistent with our conjecture, families with high variation in investment strategies across funds significantly underperform low-variation families. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

TI  - COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AND MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS
PY  - 1997
AB  - We present evidence from questionnaire responses of mutual fund investors about recollections of past fund performance. We find that investor memories exhibit a positive bias, consistent with current psychological models. We find that the degree of bias is conditional upon previous investor choice, a phenomenon related to the well-known theory of cognitive dissonance. Psychological and economic frictions in the mutual fund industry are examined via a cross-sectional study of equity mutual funds. We find an unusually high frequency of poorly performing funds, consistent with investor “inertia.” We also examine the differential responses of investment dollars to past performance, controlling for survivorship. These show that the effect is confined to the top quartile. We find little evidence that the response to poor performance is unusual.

TI  - Is Money Smart? A Study of Mutual Fund Investors' Fund Selection Ability
PY  - 1999
AB  - A previous study finds evidence to support selection ability among active fund investors for equity funds listed in 1982. Using a large sample of equity funds, I find evidence that funds that receive more money subsequently perform significantly better than those that lose money. This effect is short-lived and is largely but not completely explained by a strategy of betting on winners. In the aggregate, there is no significant evidence that funds that receive more money subsequently beat the market. However, it is possible to earn positive abnormal returns by using the cash flow information for small funds. HAVING EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC GROWTH in the past two decades, the mutual fund industry plays an important role in the U.S. economy. As a major investment vehicle, open-end mutual funds at the end of the first quarter of 1998 managed about $3.3 trillion in assets, a sum that exceeds all bank savings deposits. Due to the great number of funds in existence, evaluating managers' performance and selecting funds with relatively high riskadjusted returns can be an especially difficult and challenging task. The growth of data companies such as Lipper, Morningstar, and Micropal and the explosion in the publication of books and articles on mutual funds both reflect investors' tremendous demand for detailed mutual fund information and investment advice. This huge demand suggests that many investors are making mutual fund investment decisions themselves and many of them study current and historical information about funds carefully during the decision-making process.

TI  - Another Puzzle: The Growth in Actively Managed Mutual Funds
PY  - 1996
AB  - Mutual funds represent one of the fastest growing type of financial intermediary in the American economy. The question remains as to why mutual funds and in particular actively managed mutual funds have grown so fast, when their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. One possible explanation of why investors buy actively managed open end funds lies in the fact that they are bought and sold at net asset value, and thus management ability may not be priced. If management ability exists and it is not included in the price of open end funds, then performance should be predictable. If performance is predictable and at least some investors are aware of this, then cash flows into and out of funds should be predictable by the very same metrics that predict performance. Finally, if predictors exist and at least some investors act on these predictors in investing in mutual funds, the return on new cash flows should be better than the average return for all investors in these funds. This article presents empirical evidence on all of these issues and shows that investors in actively managed mutual funds may have been more rational than we have assumed.

TI  - Decisions with Multiple Objectives
PY  - 1993
AB  - <jats:p>Many of the complex problems faced by decision makers involve multiple conflicting objectives. This book describes how a confused decision maker, who wishes to make a reasonable and responsible choice among alternatives, can systematically probe his true feelings in order to make those critically important, vexing trade-offs between incommensurable objectives. The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximise. By generalising from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis.</jats:p>

TI  - Intuitive Prediction: Biases and Corrective Procedures
PY  - 1982
AB  - Abstract : This paper presents an approach to elicitation and correction of intuitive forecasts, which attempts to retain the valid component of intuitive judgments while correcting some biases to which they are prone. This approach is applied to two tasks that experts are often required to perform in the context of forecasting and in the service of decision making: the prediction of values and the assessment of confidence intervals. The analysis of these judgments reveals two major biases: non-regressiveness of predictions and overconfidence. Both biases are traced to people's tendency to give insufficient weight to certain types of information, e.g., the base-rate frequency of outcomes and their predictability. The corrective procedures described in this paper are designed to elicit from experts relevant information which they would normally neglect, and to help them integrate this information with their intuitive impressions in a manner that respects basic principles of statistical prediction.

A typical classroom explanation of the determinationof capital asset prices, for example, usually begins with a carefull and relatively rigorous description of the process through which individuals preferences and phisical relationship to determine an equilibrium pure interest rate. This is generally followed by the assertion that somehow a market risk-premium is also determined, with the prices of asset adjusting accordingly to account for differences of their risk.

PY  - 1994
AB  - For many years, scholars and investment professionals have argued that value strategies outperform the market. These value strategies call for buying stocks that have low prices relative to earnings, dividends, book assets, or other measures of fundamental value. While there is some agreement that value strategies produce higher returns, the interpretation of why they do so is more controversial. This article provides evidence that value strategies yield higher returns because these strategies exploit the suboptimal behavior of the typical investor and not because these strategies are fundamentally riskier.

TI  - Does the Stock Market Overreact
PY  - 1985
AB  - Research in experimental psychology suggests that, in violation of Bayes' rule, most people tend to "overreact" to unexpected and dramatic news events. This study of market efficiency investigates whether such behavior affects stock prices. The empirical evidence, based on CRSP monthly return data, is consistent with the overreaction hypothesis. Substantial weak form market inefficiencies are discovered. The results also shed new light on the January returns earned by prior "winners" and "losers." Portfolios of losers experience exceptionally large January returns as late as five years after portfolio formation. As ECONOMISTS INTERESTED IN both market behavior and the psychology of individual decision making, we have been struck by the similarity of two sets of empirical findings. Both classes of behavior can be characterized as displaying overreaction. This study was undertaken to investigate the possibility that these phenomena are related by more than just appearance. We begin by describing briefly the individual and market behavior that piqued our interest. The term overreaction carries with it an implicit comparison to some degree of reaction that is considered to be appropriate. What is an appropriate reaction? One class,,of tasks which have a well-established norm are probability revision problems for which Bayes' rule prescribes the correct reaction to new information. It has now been well-established that Bayes' rule is not an apt characterization of how individuals actually respond to new data (Kahneman et al. [14]). In revising their beliefs, individuals tend to overweight recent information and underweight prior (or base rate) data. People seem to make predictions according to a simple matching rule: "The predicted value is selected so that the standing of the case in the distribution of outcomes matches its standing in the distribution of impressions" (Kahneman and Tversky [14, p. 416]). This rule-of-thumb, an instance of what Kahneman and Tversky call the representativeness heuristic, violates the basic statistical principal that the extremeness of predictions must be moderated by considerations of predictability. Grether [12] has replicated this finding under incentive compatible conditions. There is also considerable evidence that the actual expectations of professional security analysts and economic forecasters display the same overreaction bias (for a review, see De Bondt [7]). One of the earliest observations about overreaction in markets was made by J. M. Keynes:"... day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments,

TI  - Product Differentiation, Search Costs, and Competition in the Mutual Fund Industry: A Case Study of S&P 500 Index Funds
PY  - 2004
AB  - We investigate the role that non-portfolio fund differentiation and information/search frictions play in creating two salient features of the mutual fund industry: the large number of funds and the sizeable dispersion in fund fees. In a case study, we find that despite the financial homogeneity of S&P 500 index funds, this sector exhibits the fund proliferation and fee dispersion observed in the broader industry. We show how extra-portfolio mechanisms explain these features. These mechanisms also suggest an explanation for the puzzling late-1990s shift in sector assets to more expensive (and often newly entered) funds: an influx of highinformation-cost novice investors.

TI  - Stale Prices and Strategies for Trading Mutual Funds
PY  - 2002
AB  - We demonstrate that an institutional feature of numerous mutual funds—funds managing billions in assets—generates fund net asset values that reflect stale prices. Because investors can trade at these NAVs with limited transaction costs in many cases, obvious trading opportunities exist. These opportunities are especially prevalent in funds that buy Japanese or European equities. Simple, feasible strategies generate Sharpe ratios (excess return divided by standard deviation) that are many times greater than the Sharpe ratio of the underlying fund. We illustrate the potential of the strategy for three Vanguard Group mutual funds. A particular issue to keep in mind is that when the strategies are implemented, the gains from these strategies are matched by offsetting losses incurred by buy-and-hold investors in these funds.

TI  - The Cross‐Section of Expected Stock Returns
PY  - 1992
AB  - Two easily measured variables, size and book-to-market equity, combine to capture the cross-sectional variation in average stock returns associated with market 3, size, leverage, book-to-market equity, and earnings-price ratios. Moreover, when the tests allow for variation in 3 that is unrelated to size, the relation between market /3 and average return is flat, even when 3 is the only explanatory variable. THE ASSET-PRICING MODEL OF Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Black (1972) has long shaped the way academics and practitioners think about average returns and risk. The central prediction of the model is that the market portfolio of invested wealth is mean-variance efficient in the sense of Markowitz (1959). The efficiency of the market portfolio implies that (a) expected returns on securities are a positive linear function of their market O3s (the slope in the regression of a security's return on the market's return), and (b) market O3s suffice to describe the cross-section of expected returns. There are several empirical contradictions of the Sharpe-Lintner-Black (SLB) model. The most prominent is the size effect of Banz (1981). He finds that market equity, ME (a stock's price times shares outstanding), adds to the explanation of the cross-section of average returns provided by market Os. Average returns on small (low ME) stocks are too high given their f estimates, and average returns on large stocks are too low. Another contradiction of the SLB model is the positive relation between leverage and average return documented by Bhandari (1988). It is plausible that leverage is associated with risk and expected return, but in the SLB model, leverage risk should be captured by market S. Bhandari finds, howev er, that leverage helps explain the cross-section of average stock returns in tests that include size (ME) as well as A. Stattman (1980) and Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985) find that average returns on U.S. stocks are positively related to the ratio of a firm's book value of common equity, BE, to its market value, ME. Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991) find that book-to-market equity, BE/ME, also has a strong role in explaining the cross-section of average returns on Japanese stocks.

TI  - INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF COMMON STOCKS IN RELATION TO THEIR PRICE-EARNINGS RATIOS: A TEST OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
PY  - 1977
AB  - IN AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKET, security prices fully reflect available information in a rapid and unbiased fashion and thus provide unbiased estimates of the underlying values. While there is substantial empirical evidence supporting the efficient market hypothesis,' many still question its validity. One such group believes that price-earnings (P/E) ratios are indicators of the future investment performance of a security. Proponents of this price-ratio hypothesis claim that low P/E securities will tend to outperform high P/E stocks.2 In short, prices of securities are biased, and the P/E ratio is an indicator of this bias.3 A finding that returns on stocks with low P/E ratios tends to be larger than warranted by the underlying risks, even after adjusting for any additional search and transactions costs, and differential taxes, would be inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis.4 The purpose of this paper is to determine empirically whether the investment performance of common stocks is related to their P/E ratios. In Section II data, sample, and estimation procedures are outlined. Empirical results are discussed in Section III, and conclusions and implications are given in Section IV.

TI  - Day Trading International Mutual Funds: Evidence and Policy Solutions
PY  - 2001
AB  - Daily pricing of mutual funds provides liquidity to investors but is subject to valuation errors due to the inability to observe synchronous, fair security prices at the end of the trading day. This mayhurt fund investor if speculatior strategiclly seek to exploit mispricing or if the net flow of money into funds is correlated with these pricing eerrors. We show that mutual funds are exposed to speculative traders by using a simple day trading rule that yields large profits in a sample of 391 U.S.-based open-end international mutual funds. We propose a simple “fair pricing” mechanism that alleviated these concerns by correcting net asset values for stale prices. We argue that fund companies and regulatiors should look at alternatives that allow funds to offer fair prciing to investors, which, in turn, decreases the need to resort to monitoring for day traders and redemption penalties.

TI  - The Determinants of Mutual Fund Starts
PY  - 1999
AB  - For a sample of 1163 mutual funds started over the period 1979‐1992, we find that fund initiations are positively related to the level of assets invested in and the capital gains embedded in other funds with the same objective, the fund family’s prior performance, the fraction of funds in the family in the low range of fees, and the decision by large families to open similar funds in the prior year. In addition, consistent with the presence of scale and scope economies in fund openings, we find that large families and families that have more experience in opening funds in the past are more likely to open new funds. The dramatic growth in mutual funds in recent years has been one of the most significant developments in the financial services industry. Mutual fund organizations wield significant market power in today’s financial markets both in terms of their ability to control large equity stakes in publicly traded corporations and their ability to affect market prices. 1 Despite rapid industry growth both in terms of the total assets under management and the number of fund offerings available to investors, little attention has been devoted to the decision-making process within funds and fund families. In particular, the factors that fund families consider in their decision to open a new fund have not been closely examined. Understanding the new fund opening decision assumes added importance in light of the fact that new funds in existence for less than 1 year (2 years) controlled as much as 6% (25%) of all fund assets in any given year during the 1980s and early 1990s. In this article, we investigate the rationale behind the emergence of new funds, both by new families as well as by existing families of funds. Understanding why new funds get started is useful for all the constituents: (i) academics would be interested since it highlights the industrial organization

AB  - Daily returns are used to examine how mutual funds actively alter the risk of their portfolios in response to past performance. Compared to monthly data, daily returns produce much more efficient estimates of fund volatility, which give vastly different inferences about the behavior of fund managers. In particular, monthly results consistent with under-performers increasing their risk relative to better performing funds disappear with daily data. The differences in the monthly and daily results arise from biases in the monthly volatility estimates attributable to daily return autocorrelation.

PY  - 2002
AB  - This study compares the relations between asset flow and performance in the retail mutual fund and fiduciary pension fund segments of the money management industry, and relates empirical differences to fundamental differences in the clientele they serve. A striking difference is the shape of the flow-performance relation. In contrast to mutual fund investors, pension clients punish poorly performing managers by withdrawing assets under management and do not flock disproportionately to recent winners. We interpret these and other empirical differences in the context of the manager evaluation procedures typical in each segment. We conclude that pension managers have little incentive to engage in the risk-shifting behavior previously identified among mutual fund managers.

TI  - THE VALUATION OF RISK ASSETS AND THE SELECTION OF RISKY INVESTMENTS IN STOCK PORTFOLIOS AND CAPITAL BUDGETS
PY  - 1965
AB  - Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the problem of selecting optimal security portfolios by risk-averse investors who have the alternative of investing in risk-free securities with a positive return or borrowing at the same rate of interest and who can sell short if they wish. It presents alternative and more transparent proofs under these more general market conditions for Tobin's important separation theorem that “ … the proportionate composition of the non-cash assets is independent of their aggregate share of the investment balance … and for risk avertere in purely competitive markets when utility functions are quadratic or rates of return are multivariate normal. The chapter focuses on the set of risk assets held in risk averters' portfolios. It discusses various significant equilibrium properties within the risk asset portfolio. The chapter considers a few implications of the results for the normative aspects of the capital budgeting decisions of a company whose stock is traded in the market. It explores the complications introduced by institutional limits on amounts that either individuals or corporations may borrow at given rates, by rising costs of borrowed funds, and certain other real world complications.

TI  - EQUILIBRIUM IN A CAPITAL ASSET MARKET
PY  - 1966
AB  - This paper investigates the properties of a market for risky assets on the basis of a simple model of general equilibrium of exchange, where individual investors seek to maximize preference functions over expected yield and variance of yield on their port- folios. A theory of market risk premiums is outlined, and it is shown that general equilibrium implies the existence of a so-called "market line," relating per dollar expected yield and standard deviation of yield. The concept of price of risk is discussed in terms of the slope of this line.

TI  - Further Evidence On Investor Overreaction and Stock Market Seasonality
PY  - 1987
AB  - In a previous paper, we found systematic price reversals for stocks that experience extreme long-term gains or losses: Past losers significantly outperform past winners. We interpreted this finding as consistent with the behavioral hypothesis of investor overreaction. In this follow-up paper, additional evidence is reported that supports the overreaction hypothesis and that is inconsistent with two alternative hypotheses based on firm size and differences in risk, as measured by CAPM-betas. The seasonal pattern of returns is also examined. Excess returns in January are related to both short-term and long-term past performance, as well as to the previous year market return.

TI  - Decisions with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value Trade-Offs
PY  - 1976
AB  - Many of the complex problems faced by decision makers involve multiple conflicting objectives. This book describes how a confused decision maker, who wishes to make a reasonable and responsible choice among alternatives, can systematically probe his true feelings in order to make those critically important, vexing trade-offs between incommensurable objectives. The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximise. By generalising from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis.

PY  - 1990
AB  - This paper introduces a utility function that nests three classes of utility functions: (1) time-separable utility functions; (2) "catching up with the Joneses" utility functions that depend on the consumer's level of consumption relative to the lagged cross-sectional average level of consumption; and (3) utility functions that display habit formation. Closed-form solutions for equilibrium asset prices are derived under the assumption that consumption growth is i.i.d. The equity premia under catching up with the Joneses and under habit formation are, for some parameter values, as large as the historically observed equity premium in the United States

TI  - THE PERFORMANCE OF MUTUAL FUNDS IN THE PERIOD 1945–1964
PY  - 1968
AB  - In this paper I derive a risk-adjusted measure of portfolio performance (now known as Jensen's Alpha) that estimates how much a manager's forecasting ability contributes to the fund's returns. The measure is based on the theory of the pricing of capital assets by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965a) and Treynor (Undated). I apply the measure to estimate the predictive ability of 115 mutual fund managers in the period 1945-1964 - that is their ability to earn returns which are higher than those we would expect given the level of risk of each of the portfolios. The foundations of the model and the properties of the performance measure suggested here are discussed in Section II. The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. It is also important to note that these conclusions hold even when we measure the fund returns gross of management expenses (that is assume their bookkeeping, research, and other expenses except brokerage commissions were obtained free). Thus on average the funds apparently were not quite successful enough in their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage expenses.

TI  - Consumer Reaction to Measures of Poor Quality: Evidence from the Mutual Fund Industry
PY  - 1992
AB  - U NLESS quality is apparent at the point of sale, the market must find ways to ensure the delivery of high-quality products; otherwise, producers have incentives to sell low-quality goods at high-quality prices, thereby assuring a degenerate equilibrium.1 Various solutions to this problem have been proposed, most revolving around bonding mechanisms.2 For bonds to work, however, consumers must react to the delivery of less-than-promised quality.3 In general, the faster consumers detect and react to delivery of low-quality products, the more efficient the market is in delivering high-quality products.4 Despite its prominence in the theoretical literature, direct evidence of consumer response to less-than-promised quality is rarely measured. This is a shortcoming presumably attributable to the difficulty of measuring both the difference between expected and actual product quality and

TI  - Boys will be Boys: Gender, Overconfidence, and Common Stock Investment
PY  - 2001
AB  - Theoretical models predict that overconedent investors trade excessively. We test this prediction by partitioning investors on gender. Psychological research demonstrates that, in areas such as enance, men are more overconedent than women. Thus, theory predicts that men will trade more excessively than women. Using account data for over 35,000 households from a large discount brokerage, we analyze the common stock investments of men and women from February 1991 through January 1997. We document that men trade 45 percent more than women. Trading reduces men’s net returns by 2.65 percentage points a year as opposed to 1.72 percentage points for women. It’s not what a man don’t know that makes him a fool, but what he does know that ain’t so.

Rational investors make periodic contributions and withdrawals from their investment portfolios, rebalance their portfolios, and trade to minimize their taxes. Those possessed of superior information may trade speculatively, although rational speculative traders will generally not choose to trade with each other.

TI  - How Investors Interpret Past Fund Returns
PY  - 2003
AB  - The literature documents a convex relation between past returns and fund flows of mutual funds. We show this to be consistent with fund incentives, because funds discard exactly those strategies which underperform. Past returns tell less about the future performance of funds which discard, so flows are less sensitive to them when they are poor. Our model predicts that strategy changes only occur after bad performance, and that bad performers who change strategy have dollar flow and future performance that are less sensitive to current performance than those that do not. Empirical tests support both predictions.

TI  - Does the Stock Market Overreact?
PY  - 1985
AB  - Research in experimental psychology suggests that, in violation of Bayes' rule, most people tend to “overreact” to unexpected and dramatic news events. This study of market efficiency investigates whether such behavior affects stock prices. The empirical evidence, based on CRSP monthly return data, is consistent with the overreaction hypothesis. Substantial weak form market inefficiencies are discovered. The results also shed new light on the January returns earned by prior “winners” and “losers.” Portfolios of losers experience exceptionally large January returns as late as five years after portfolio formation.

TI  - The relationship between return and market value of common stocks
PY  - 1981
AB  - This study examines the empirical relattonship between the return and the total market value of NYSE common stocks. It is found that smaller firms have had htgher risk adjusted returns, on average, than larger lirms. This ‘size effect’ has been in existence for at least forty years and is evidence that the capital asset pricing model is misspecttied. The size elfect is not linear in the market value; the main effect occurs for very small tirms while there is little difference m return between average sized and large firms. It IS not known whether size per se is responsible for the effect or whether size IS just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors correlated with size. The single-period capital asset pricing model (henceforth CAPM) postulates a simple linear relationship between the expected return and the market risk of a security. While the results of direct tests have been inconclusive, recent evidence suggests the existence of additional factors which are relevant for asset pricing. Litzenberger and Ramaswamy (1979) show a significant positive relationship between dividend yield and return of common stocks for the 1936-1977 period. Basu (1977) finds that pricee earnings ratios and risk adjusted returns are related. He chooses to interpret his findings as evidence of market inefficiency but as Ball (1978) points out, market efftciency tests are often joint tests of the efficient market hypothesis and a particular equilibrium relationship. Thus, some of the anomalies that have been attributed to a lack of market efficiency might well be the result of a misspecification of the pricing model. This study contributes another piece to the emerging puzzle. It examines the relationship between the total market value of the common stock of a firm and its return. The results show that, in the 193661975 period, the common stock of small firms had, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns *This study ts based on part of my dtssertatton and was completed while 1 was at the Umverstty of Chtcago. 1 am grateful to my committee, Myron Scholes (chairman), John Gould.

AB  - Abstract We construct optimal portfolios of equity funds by combining historical returns on funds and passive indexes with prior views about asset pricing and skill. By including both benchmark and nonbenchmark indexes, we distinguish pricing-model inaccuracy from managerial skill. Modest confidence in a pricing model helps construct portfolios with high Sharpe ratios. Investing in active mutual funds can be optimal even for investors who believe managers cannot outperform passive indexes. Optimal portfolios exclude hot-hand funds even for investors who believe momentum is priced. Our large universe of funds offers no close substitutes for the Fama-French and momentum benchmarks.

TI  - Is There a Cost to Being Socially Responsible in Investing
PY  - 1997
AB  - In this study we address three questions concerning socially responsible investing. First, is the average return of a socially screened equity universe statistically different from the average return of an unscreened universe for the 1987–94 period? Second, do analysts' earnings per share forecasts aid a manager in selecting stocks in socially screened and unscreened universes? Third, can one use an expected return model incorporating both value and growth components to select stocks and create portfolios in the socially screened and unscreened equity universes such that one can outperform both universe benchmarks? We find no statistically significant differences in the mean returns of unscreened and screened equity universes for the 1987–94 period. Earnings forecasts and the knowledge of those forecasts add value in the creation of portfolios. We find few statistically significant differences in the predictive power of the composite model to select stocks in both unscreened and screened equity universes. The estimated composite model offers the potential for substantial outperformance of socially screened and unscreened equity universes. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964
PY  - 1968
AB  - The ability of the portfolio manager or security analyst to increase returns on the portfolio through successful prediction of future security prices, and The ability of the portfolio manager to minimize (through “efficient” diversification) the amount of “insurable risk” born by the holders of the portfolio. The major difficulty encountered in attempting to evaluate the performance of a portfolio in these two dimensions has been the lack of a thorough understanding of the nature and measurement of “risk.” Evidence seems to indicate a predominance of risk aversion in the capital markets, and as long as investors correctly perceive the “riskiness” of various assets this implies that “risky” assets must on average yield higher returns than less “risky” assets.1 Hence in evaluating the “performance” of portfolios the effects of differential degrees of risk on the returns of those portfolios must be taken into account. Recent developments in the theory of the pricing of capital assets by Sharpe 20, Lintner 15 and Treynor 25 allow us to formulate explicit measures of a portfolio's performance in each of the dimensions outlined above. These measures are derived and discussed in detail in Jensen 11. However, we shall confine our attention here only to the problem of evaluating a portfolio manager's predictive ability—that is his ability to earn returns through successful prediction of security prices which are higher than those which we could expect given the level of riskiness of his portfolio. The foundations of the model and the properties of the performance measure suggested here (which is somewhat different than that proposed in 11) are discussed in Section II. The model is illustrated in Section III by an application of it to the evaluation of the performance of 115 open end mutual funds in the period 1945–1964. A number of people in the past have attempted to evaluate the performance of portfolios2 (primarily mutual funds), but almost all of these authors have relied heavily on relative measures of performance when what we really need is an absolute measure of performance. That is, they have relied mainly on procedures for ranking portfolios. For example, if there are two portfolios A and B, we not only would like to know whether A is better (in some sense) than B, but also whether A and B are good or bad relative to some absolute standard. The measure of performance suggested below is such an absolute measure.3 It is important to emphasize here again that the word “performance” is used here only to refer to a fund manager's forecasting ability. It does not refer to a portfolio's “efficiency” in the Markowitz-Tobin sense. A measure of “efficiency” and its relationship to certain measures of diversification and forecasting ability is derived and discussed in detail in Jensen 11. For purposes of brevity we confine ourselves here to an examination of a fund manager's forecasting ability which is of interest in and of itself (witness the widespread interest in the theory of random walks and its implications regarding forecasting success). In addition to the lack of an absolute measure of performance, these past studies of portfolio performance have been plagued with problems associated with the definition of “risk” and the need to adequately control for the varying degrees of riskiness among portfolios. The measure suggested below takes explicit account of the effects of “risk” on the returns of the portfolio. Finally, once we have a measure of portfolio “performance” we also need to estimate the measure's sampling error. That is we want to be able to measure its “significance” in the usual statistical sense. Such a measure of significance also is suggested below. Thus eq. (1) implies that the expected return on any asset is equal to the risk free rate plus a risk premium given by the product of the systematic risk of the asset and the risk premium on the market portfolio.5 The risk premium on the market portfolio is the difference between the expected returns on the market portfolio and the risk free rate. Equation (1) then simply tells us what any security (or portfolio) can be expected to earn given its level of systematic risk, β j . If a portfolio manager or security analyst is able to predict future security prices he will be able to earn higher returns that those implied by eq. (1) and the riskiness of his portfolio. We now wish to show how (1) can be adapted and extended to provide an estimate of the forecasting ability of any portfolio manager. Note that (1) is stated in terms of the expected returns on any security or portfolio j and the expected returns on the market portfolio. Since these expectations are strictly unobservable we wish to show how (1) can be recast in terms of the objectively measurable realizations of returns on any portfolio j and the market portfolio M. The left hand side of (7) is the risk premium earned on the j'th portfolio. As long as the asset pricing model is valid this premium is equal to β j [ R ~ M t − R F t ] plus the random error term e ~ j t . The Measure of Performance.—Furthermore eq. (7) may be used directly for empirical estimation. If we wish to estimate the systematic risk of any individual security or of an unmanaged portfolio the constrained regression estimate of β j in eq. (7) will be an efficient estimate11 of this systematic risk. However, we must be very careful when applying the equation to managed portfolios. If the manager is a superior forecaster (perhaps because of special knowledge not available to others) he will tend to systematically select securities which realize e ~ j t > 0. Hence his portfolio will earn more than the “normal” risk premium for its level of risk. We must allow for this possibility in estimating the systematic risk of a managed portfolio. The new error term u ~ j t will now have E ( u ~ j t ) = 0, and should be serially independent.12 Thus if the portfolio manager has an ability to forecast security prices, the intercept, α j , in eq. (8) will be positive. Indeed, it represents the average incremental rate of return on the portfolio per unit time which is due solely to the manager's ability to forecast future security prices. It is interesting to note that a naive random selection buy and hold policy can be expected to yield a zero intercept. In addition if the manager is not doing as well as a random selection buy and hold policy, α j will be negative. At first glance it might seem difficult to do worse than a random selection policy, but such results may very well be due to the generation of too many expenses in unsuccessful forecasting attempts. However, given that we observe a positive intercept in any sample of returns on a portfolio we have the difficulty of judging whether or not this observation was due to mere random chance or to the superior forecasting ability of the portfolio manager. Thus in order to make inferences regarding the fund manager's forecasting ability we need a measure of the standard error of estimate of the performance measure. Least squares regression theory provides an estimate of the dispersion of the sampling distribution of the intercept α j . Furthermore, the sampling distribution of the estimate, α ˆ j , is a student t distribution with n j − 2 degrees of freedom. These facts give us the information needed to make inferences regarding the statistical significance of the estimated performance measure. It should be emphasized that in estimating α j , the measure of performance, we are explicitly allowing for the effects of risk on return as implied by the asset pricing model. Moreover, it should also be noted that if the model is valid, the particular nature of general economic conditions or the particular market conditions (the behavior of π) over the sample or evaluation period has no effect whatsoever on the measure of performance. Thus our measure of performance can be legitimately compared across funds of different risk levels and across differing time periods irrespective of general economic and market conditions. The Effects of Non-Stationarity of the Risk Parameter.—It was pointed out earlier13 that by omitting the time subscript from β j (the risk parameter in eq. (8)) we were implicitly assuming the risk level of the portfolio under consideration is stationary through time. However, we know this need not be strictly true since the portfolio manager can certainly change the risk level of his portfolio very easily. He can simply switch from more risky to less risky equities (or vice versa), or he can simply change the distribution of the assets of the portfolio between equities, bonds and cash. Indeed the portfolio manager may consciously switch his portfolio holdings between equities, bonds and cash in trying to outguess the movements of the market. This consideration brings us to an important issue regarding the meaning of “forecasting ability.” A manager's forecasting ability may consist of an ability to forecast the price movements of individual securities and/or an ability to forecast the general behavior of security prices in the future (the “market factor” π in our model). Therefore we want an evaluation model which will incorporate and reflect the ability of the manager to forecast the market's behavior as well as his ability to choose individual issues. Thus the estimate of the risk parameter is biased downward by an amount given by a j E ( R ~ M ), where a j is the parameter given in eq. (10) (which describes the relationship between ε ~ j t and π ~ t ). By the arguments given earlier a j can never be negative and will be equal to zero when the manager possesses no market forecasting ability. This is important since it means that if the manager is unable to forecast general market movements we obtain an unbiased estimate of his ability to increase returns on the portfolio by choosing individual securities which are “undervalued.” However, if the manager does have an ability to forecast market movements we have seen that a j will be positive and therefore as shown in eq. (12) the estimated risk parameter will be biased downward. This means, of course, that the estimated performance measure ( α ˆ ) will be biased upward (since the regression line must pass through the point of sample means). Hence it seems clear that if the manager can forecast market movements at all we most certainly should see evidence of it since our techniques will tend to overstate the magnitude of the effects of this ability. That is, the performance measure, α j , will be positive for two reasons: (1) the extra returns actually earned on the portfolio due to the manager's ability, and (2) the positive bias in the estimate of α j resulting from the negative bias in our estimate of β j . The Data.—The sample consists of the returns on the portfolios of 115 open end mutual funds for which net asset and dividend information was available in Wiesenberger's Investment Companies for the ten-year period 1955–64.16 The funds are listed in Table 1 along with an identification number and code denoting the fund objectives (growth, income, etc.). Annual data were gathered for the period 1955–64 for all 115 funds and as many additional observations as possible were collected for these funds in the period 1945–54. For this earlier period, 10 years of complete data were obtained for 56 of the original 115 funds. Definitions of the Variables.—The following are the exact definitions of the variables used in the estimation procedures: The Empirical Results.—Table 2 presents some summary statistics of the frequency distributions of the regression estimates of the parameters of eq. (8) for all 115 mutual funds using all sample data available for each fund in the period 1945–64. The table presents the mean, median, extreme values, and mean absolute deviation of the 115 estimates of α, β, r 2 , and ρ ( u t , u t − 1 ) (the first order autocorrelation of residuals). As can be seen in the table the average intercept was −.011 with a minimum value of −.078 and a maximum value of .058. We defer a detailed discussion of the implications of these estimated intercepts for a moment. Since the average value of β was only .840, on average these funds tended to hold portfolios which were less risky than the market portfolio. Thus any attempt to compare the average returns on these funds to the returns on a market index without explicit adjustment for differential riskiness would be biased against the funds. The average squared correlation coefficient, r ˆ 2 , was .865 and indicates in general that eq. (8) fits the data for most of the funds quite closely. The average first order autocorrelation of residuals, −.077, is quite small as expected. Our primary concern in this paper is the interpretation of the estimated intercepts. They are presented in Table 3 along with the fund identification number and the “t” values and sample sizes. The observations are ordered from lowest to highest on the basis of α ˆ . The estimates range from −.0805 to +.0582. Table 4 and Figures 1–4 present summary frequency distributions of these estimates (along with the distributions of the coefficients estimated for several other time intervals which will be discussed below). Frequency distribution (from col. (1), Table 4) of estimated intercepts ( α ˆ ) for eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for all years available for each fund. Fund returns calculated net of all expenses. In order to obtain additional information about the forecasting success of fund managers eq. (8) was also estimated using fund returns calculated before deduction of fund expenses as well as after. Fund loading charges were ignored in all cases.20 Columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 and Figures 1 and 2 present the frequency distributions of the estimated a's obtained by using all sample data available for each fund. The number of observations in the estimating equation varies from 10 to 20 and the time periods are obviously not all identical. Column 1 and Figure 1 present the frequency distribution of the 115 intercepts estimated on the basis of fund returns calculated net of all expenses. Column 2 of Table 4 and Figure 2 present the frequency distributions of the estimates obtained from the fund returns calculated before deductions of management expenses (as given by Wiesenberger 2621). Frequency distribution (from col. (2), Table 4) of estimated intercepts ( α ˆ ) for eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for all years available for each fund. Fund returns calculated gross of all management expenses. The average value of α ˆ calculated net of expenses was −.011 which indicates that on average the funds earned about 1.1% less per year (compounded continuously) than they should have earned given their level of systematic risk. It is also clear from Figure 1 that the distribution is skewed to the low side with 76 funds having α ˆ j < 0 and only 39 with α ˆ j > 0. Frequency distribution (from col. (3), Table 4) of estimated intercepts ( α ˆ ) for eq. (8) for 56 mutual funds for which complete data were available in the period 1945–64. Fund returns calculated gross of all management expenses. The model implies that with a random selection buy and hold policy one should expect on average to do no worse than α = 0. Thus it appears from the preponderance of negative α's that the funds are not able to forecast future security prices well enough to recover their research expenses, management fees and commission expenses. Frequency distribution (from col. (4), Table 4) of estimated intercepts ( α ˆ ) for eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for the 10 years 1955–64. Fund returns calculated gross of all management expenses. The results shown in Column 2 of Table 4 indicate the average α ˆ estimated from gross return data was −.004 or −.4% per year, with 67 funds for which α ˆ < 0 and 48 for which α ˆ > 0. The frequency distribution, plotted in Figure 2, is much more symmetric than the distribution obtained from the net returns. Thus it appears that on average during this 20-year period the funds were not able to increase returns enough by their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage commissions (the only expenses which were not added back to the fund returns). In order to avoid the difficulties associated with non-identical time periods and unequal sample sizes, the measures for the 56 funds for which data were available for the entire 20-year period are summarized in Column 3 of Table 4 and Figure 3. The results indicate an average α ˆ of −.032 with 32 funds for which α ˆ j < 0 and 24 funds for which α ˆ j > 0. It is very likely that part of this apparently poorer gross performance is due to the method used in approximating the expenses for the years prior to 1955. It was noted earlier that the expenses for these earlier years were assumed to be equal to the expenses for 1955. But since these expense ratios were declining in the earlier period these estimates are undoubtedly too low. Finally in order to avoid any difficulty associated with the estimates of the expenses before 1955, the measures were estimated for each of the 115 funds using only the gross return data in the 10-year period 1955–64. The frequency distribution of the α ˆ 's is given in Column 4 of Table 4 and Figure 4. The average α ˆ for this period was −.001 or −.1% per year with 55 funds for which α ˆ < 0 and 60 funds for which α ˆ > 0. The reader must be careful about placing too much significance on the seemingly larger number of funds with α ˆ > 0. It is well known that measurement errors (even though unbiased) in any independent variable will cause the estimated regression coefficient of that variable to be attenuated towards zero (cf. [12, chap. 6]). Since we know that there are undoubtedly some errors in the measurement of both the riskless rate and the estimated returns on the market portfolio, the coefficients β ˆ j are undoubtedly slightly downward biased. This of course results in an upward bias in the estimates of the α j since the least squares regression line must pass through the point of means. There is one additional item which tends to bias the results slightly against the funds. That is, the model implicitly assumes the portfolio is fully invested. But since the mutual funds face stochastic inflows and outflows they must maintain a cash balance to meet them. Data presented in [8, pp. 120–127] indicate that on average the funds appear to hold about 2% of their total net assets in cash. If we assume the funds had earned the riskless rate on these assets (about 3% per year) this would increase their returns (and the average α ˆ ) by about ( . 02 ) ( . 03 ) = . 0006 per year. Thus the adjusted average α ˆ is about −.0004, and it is now getting very difficult to say that this is really different from zero. Thus, let us now give explicit consideration to these questions of “significance.” The “Significance” of the Estimates.—We now address ourselves to the question regarding the statistical significance of the estimated performance measures. Table 3 presents a listing of the “t” values for the individual funds, the intercepts, and the number of observations used in obtaining each estimate. We noted earlier that it is possible for a fund manager to do worse than a random selection policy since it is easy to lower a fund's returns by unwisely spending resources in unsuccessful attempts to forecast security prices. The fact that the α ˆ 's shown in Table 3 and Figure 1 are skewed to the left indicate this may well be true. Likewise an examination of the “t” values given in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 5 indicates that the t values for 14 of the funds were less than −2 and hence are all significantly negative at the 5% level.23 However, since we had little doubt that it was easy to do worse than a random policy we are really interested mainly in testing the significance of the large positive performance measures. Frequency distribution (from col. (1), Table 5) of “t” values for estimated intercepts in eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for all years available for each fund. Fund returns calculated net of all expenses. An examination of Column 3 of Table 3 reveals only 3 funds which have performance measures which are significantly positive at the 5% level. But before concluding that these funds are superior we should remember that even if all 115 of these funds had a true α equal to zero, we would expect (merely because of random chance) to find 5% of them or about 5 or 6 funds yielding t values “significant” at the 5% level. Thus, henceforth we shall concentrate on an examination of the entire frequency distribution of the estimated t values to see whether we observe more than the expected number of significant values. Unfortunately because of the differing degrees of freedom among the observations plotted in Figure 5 and Figure 6 (which contains the gross estimates), the frequency distributions are somewhat difficult to interpret. However Figure 7 presents the frequency distribution of the t values calculated on the basis of gross returns for the 56 funds for which 20 complete years of data were available. The t value for the one-tail 2.5% level of significance is 2.1, and thus we expect ( . 025 ) ( 56 ) = 1 . 4 observations with t values greater than 2.1. We observe just one. Again we also observe a definite skewness towards the negative values and no evidence of an ability to forecast security prices. It is interesting to note that if the model is valid and if we have indeed returned all expenses to the funds, these distributions should be symmetric about zero. However, we have not added back any of the brokerage commissions and have used estimates of the expenses for the years 1945–54 which we strongly suspect are biased low. Thus the results shown in Figure 7 are not too surprising. As mentioned above, in order to avoid some of these difficulties and to test more precisely whether or not the funds were on average able to forecast well enough to cover their brokerage expenses (even if not their other expenses) the performance measures were estimated just for the period 1955–64. The frequency distribution for the t values of the intercepts of the 115 funds estimated from gross returns is given in Figure 8 and column 4 of Table 5. All the observations have 8 degrees of freedom, and the maximum and minimum values are respectively +2.17 and −2.84. It seems clear from the symmetry of this distribution about zero and especially from the lack of any values greater than +2.2 that there is very little evidence that any of these 115 mutual funds in this 10-year period possessed substantial forecasting ability. We refrain from making a strict formal interpretation of the statistical significance of these numbers and warn the reader to do likewise since there is a substantial amount of evidence (cf. 4, 18) which indicates the normality assumptions on the residuals, ũ jt , of (8) may not be valid. We also point out that one could also perform chi-square goodness of fit tests on the t distributions presented, but for the same reasons mentioned above we refrain from doing so. That is, if the residuals are not normally distributed the estimates of the parameters will not be distributed according to the student t distribution, and therefore it doesn't really make sense to make formal goodness of fit tests against the “t” distribution. Frequency distribution (from col. (2), Table 5) of “t” values for estimated intercepts in eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for all years available for each fund. Fund returns calculated gross of all expenses. Frequency distribution (from col. (3), Table 5) of “t” values for estimated intercepts in eq. (8) for 56 mutual funds for which complete data were available in the period 1945–64. Fund returns calculated gross of all management expenses. Frequency distribution (from col. (4), Table 5) of “t” values for estimated intercepts in eq. (8) for 115 mutual funds for the 10 year period 1955–64. Fund returns calculated gross of all management expenses. However, while the possible non-normality of these disturbances causes problems in attempting to perform the usual types of significance tests, it should be emphasized that the model itself is in no way crucially dependent on this assumption. Wise 27 has shown that the least squares estimates of b j in (2) are unbiased and consistent if the disturbance terms u j conform to the symmetric and finite mean members of the stable class of distributions. Furthermore, Fama 6 has demonstrated that the capital asset pricing model results (eq. (1)) can still be obtained in the context of these distributions. A complete discussion of the issues associated with this distributional problem and their relationship to the portfolio evaluation problem is available in 11 and will not be repeated here. It is sufficient to reiterate the fact that the normality assumption is necessary only in order to perform the strict tests of significance, and we warn the reader to interpret these tests as merely suggestive until the state of stable distribution theory is developed to the point where strict tests of significance can be legitimately performed. It is important to note in examining the empirical results presented above that the mutual fund industry (as represented by these 115 funds) shows very little evidence of an ability to forecast security prices. Furthermore there is surprisingly little evidence that indicates any individual funds in the sample might be able to forecast prices. These results are even stronger when one realizes that the biases in the estimates24 all tend to either exaggerate the magnitude of any forecasting ability which might exist25 or tend to show evidence of forecasting ability where none exists. The evidence on mutual fund performance discussed above indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. It is also important to note that these conclusions hold even when we measure the fund returns gross of management expenses (that is assume their bookkeeping, research, and other expenses except brokerage commissions were obtained free). Thus on average the funds apparently were not quite successful enough in their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage expenses. It is also important to remember that we have not considered in this paper the question of diversification. Evidence reported elsewhere (cf. Jensen 11) indicates the funds on average have done an excellent job of minimizing the “insurable” risk born by their shareholders. Thus the results reported here should not be construed as indicating the mutual funds are not providing a socially desirable service to investors; that question has not been addressed here. The evidence does indicate, however, a pressing need on the part of the funds themselves to evaluate much more closely both the costs and the benefits of their research and trading activities in order to provide investors with maximum possible returns for the level of risk undertaken.

TI  - Competing Theories of Financial Anomalies
PY  - 2002
AB  - We compare two competing theories of financial anomalies: “behavioral” theories built on investor irrationality, and “rational structural uncertainty” theories built on incomplete information about the structure of the economic environment. We find that although the theories relax opposite assumptions of the rational expectations ideal, their mathematical and predictive similarities make them difficult to distinguish. Even if irrationality generates financial anomalies, their disappearance still may hinge on rational learning—that is, on the ability of rational arbitrageurs and their investors to reject competing rational explanations for observed price patterns. In this article we explore competing theories of financial anomalies. A financial anomaly is a documented pattern of price behavior that is inconsistent with the predictions of traditional efficient markets, rational expectations asset pricing theory. That theory has two characteristic features. First, investors are assumed to have essentially complete knowledge of the fundamental structure of their economy. 1 Second, investors are assumed to be completely rational information processors who make optimal statistical decisions. Put another way, investors in the benchmark theory have “access both to the correct specification of the ‘true’ economic model and to unbiased estimators of its coefficients” [Friedman (1979, p. 38)]. As evidence has mounted against This article has benefited from the comments of Nick Barberis, Eli Berkovitch, Joshua Coval, Kent Daniel (a discussant), Werner De Bondt (a discussant), Craig Fox, John Graham, Campbell Harvey, Harrison Hong,

TI  - The Value Basis of Environmental Concern
PY  - 1994
AB  - This article describes and presents initial empirical tests of a theory that links values, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior within a preference construction framework that emphasizes the activation of personal environmental norms. Environmental concern is related to egoistic, social-altruistic, and biospheric value orientations and also to beliefs about the consequences of environmental changes for valued objects. Two studies generally support the hypothesized relationships and demonstrate links to the broader theory of values. However, the biospheric value orientation postulated in the theoretical literature on environmentalism does not differentiate from social-altruism in a general population sample. Results are discussed in terms of value change, the role of social structural factors (including gender) in environmentalism, theories of risk perception, and the mobilization strategies of social movements, including environmental justice movements.

TI  - Extending the Cross-Cultural Validity of the Theory of Basic Human Values with a Different Method of Measurement
PY  - 2001
AB  - Several studies demonstrate that Schwartz’s (1992) theory of human values is valid in cultures previously beyond its range. We measured the 10 value constructs in the theory with the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ), a new and less abstract method. Analyses in representative samples in South Africa (n = 3,210) and Italy (n = 5,867) and in samples of 13- to 14-year-old Ugandan girls (n = 840) yielded structures of relations among values similar to the theoretical prototype. In an Israeli student sample (n = 200), the values exhibited convergent and discriminant validity when measured with the PVQ and with the standard value survey. Predicted relations of value priorities with a set of 10 background, personality, attitude, and behavioral variables in the four samples supported the construct validity of the values theory with an alternative method of measurement.

TI  - Value Orientations to Explain Beliefs Related to Environmental Significant Behavior How to Measure Egoistic, Altruistic, and Biospheric Value Orientations
PY  - 2007
AB  - In environmental literature it is argued that three different value orientations may be relevant for understanding environmental beliefs and intentions: egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric. Until now, the distinction between altruistic and biospheric value orientations has hardly been supported empirically. In this article, three studies are reported aimed to examine whether an egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric value orientation can indeed be distinguished empirically by using an adapted value instrument. Also, it is examined whether these value orientations are differently and uniquely related to general and specific beliefs and behavioral intention. Results provide support for the reliability and validity of the value instrument. All studies replicated the distinction into three value orientations, with sufficient internal consistency. Furthermore, when altruistic and biospheric goals conflict, they seem to provide a distinct basis for proenvironmental intentions. The value instrument could therefor...

TI  - Environmental Attitudes in International Comparison: An Analysis of the ISSP Surveys 1993 and 2000*
PY  - 2003
AB  - Objective. The goal of this article is to compare the concern for the natural environment between the citizens of 26 countries that participated in the 2000 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and to explain the differences. Prior studies (e.g., Dunlap, Gallup, and Gallup, 1993; Brechin, 1999) suggest that the increase of environmental concern is a global phenomenon. However, Inglehart (1995), as well as Diekmann and Franzen (1999), argue that the level of environmental concern and knowledge is highly correlated with GNP per capita.

Method. The article analyzes new evidence obtained from the ISSP 2000 and compares it to the prior findings based on the ISSP 1993.

Results. It is shown that citizens in wealthier nations express greater concern for the global condition of the environment than those in poorer countries.

Conclusion. The new analysis of the ISSP 2000 confirms our original notion that support for global environmental protection is strongly correlated with wealth. However, the increase in real GDP between 1993 and 2000 did not lead to a further increase in environmental concern.

TI  - Factors influencing the acceptability of energy policies: A test of VBN theory
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract This paper examines factors influencing the acceptability of energy policies aimed to reduce the emission of CO 2 by households. More specifically, it is studied to what extent the value–belief–norm theory of environmentalism (VBN theory; Stern, [(2000) . Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior. Journal of Social Issues , 56(3), 407–424.]) is successful in explaining acceptability judgements. In contrast to previous studies, we test the full VBN theory. A questionnaire study was conducted among 112 Dutch respondents. Results confirmed the causal order of the variables in VBN theory, moving from relative stable general values to beliefs about human–environment relations, which in turn affect behaviour specific beliefs and norms, and acceptability judgements, respectively. As expected, all variables were significantly related to the next variable in the causal chain. Biospheric values were also significantly related to feelings of moral obligation to reduce household energy consumption when intermediate variables were controlled for. Furthermore, as hypothesized, personal norms mediated the relationship between AR and acceptability judgements, AR beliefs mediated the relationship between AC beliefs and personal norms, AC beliefs mediated the relationship between NEP and AR beliefs, and NEP mediated the relationship between values and AC beliefs.

TI  - Personal values and commitment to energy conservation.
PY  - 1986
AB  - Human values represent an important but neglected level of analysis in the study of energy conservation behavior. This article examines the role values play in people's commitment to energy conservation, using data from an in-depth survey of 376 households in Southern California. The impact of values on commitment is considered in terms of a theoretical framework that includes attributes of the person and his or her context. The results indicated that a number of values (particularly those pertaining to environmental quality and personal growth) were weakly but positively related to both conservation behavior and beliefs about the efficacy and necessity of conservation. Values influenced behavioral commitment independently of person and contextual factors, but did not predict such behavior above and beyond these other factors. It is concluded that personal values do not exert a major impact on personal commitment to conserve and therefore do not constitute a significant obstacle to such efforts. Public po...

TI  - A Rose by Any Name? The Values Construct
PY  - 2000
AB  - Definitional inconsistency has been epidemic in values theory and research. An abbreviated review of values-related theory and research is provided, and 5 aspects of the values construct that may have contributed to this inconsistency and the resulting lack of synthesis are discussed. A proposal for the process by which value priorities influence attitudinal and behavioral decisions also is outlined. Attitudinal and behavioral decisions are shown to be traceable to personal value priorities, although the link is indirect. The importance of 4 constructs in this process is highlighted. In the past, personal value systems, social value systems, worldviews, and ideologies each may have been given the generic label values.

TI  - Values and their Relationship to Environmental Concern and Conservation Behavior
PY  - 2005
AB  - Recent research has examined the relationship between values and attitudes about environmental issues. Findings from these studies have found values of self-transcendence (positively) and self-enhancement (negatively) to predict general concern for environmental problems. Other recent findings have differentiated between environmental attitudes based on concern for self (egoistic), concern for other people (socialaltruistic), and concern for plants and animals (biospheric). This article reports the results from a study of the relationship between values and environmental attitudes in six countries: Brazil, Czech Republic, Germany, India, New Zealand, and Russia. Results show strong support for the cross-cultural generalizability of the relationship between values and attitudes and on the structure of environmental concern. In addition, analyses of the relationship between values and environmental behavior show evidence for norm activation only for self-transcendence; results for self-enhancement show a consistently negative relationship.

TI  - Values, Beliefs, and Proenvironmental Action: Attitude Formation Toward Emergent Attitude Objects1
PY  - 1995
AB  - Discoveries in environmental science become the raw material for constructing social attitude objects, individual attitudes, and broad public concerns. We explored a model in which individuals construct attitudes to new or emergent attitude objects by referencing personal values and beliefs about the consequences of the objects for their values. We found that a subset of the major clusters identified in value theory is associated with willingness to take proenvironmental action; that a biospheric value orientation cannot yet be discerned in a general population sample; that willingness to take proenvironmental action is a function of both values and beliefs, with values also predicting beliefs; and that gender differences can be attributed to both beliefs and values. Our model has promise for explicating the factors determining public concern with environmental conditions.

TI  - Should we trust web-based studies? A comparative analysis of six preconceptions about internet questionnaires.
PY  - 2004
AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet provides a wealth of new research opportunities for psychologists. Internet data collection methods, with a focus on self-report questionnaires from self-selected samples, are evaluated and compared with traditional paper-and-pencil methods. Six preconceptions about Internet samples and data quality are evaluated by comparing a new large Internet sample (N = 361,703) with a set of 510 published traditional samples. Internet samples are shown to be relatively diverse with respect to gender, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and age. Moreover, Internet findings generalize across presentation formats, are not adversely affected by nonserious or repeat responders, and are consistent with findings from traditional methods. It is concluded that Internet methods can contribute to many areas of psychology.

TI  - Value hierarchies across cultures: Taking a similarities perspective
PY  - 2001
AB  - Beyond the striking differences in the value priorities of groups is a surprisingly widespread consensus regarding the hierarchical order of values. Average value hierarchies of representative and near representative samples from 13 nations exhibit a similar pattern that replicates with school teachers in 56 nations and college students in 54 nations. Benevolence, self-direction, and universalism values are consistently most important; power, tradition, and stimulation values are least important; and security, conformity, achievement, and hedonism are in between. Value hierarchies of 83% of samples correlate at least .80 with this pan-cultural hierarchy. To explain the pan-cultural hierarchy, the authors discuss its adaptive functions in meeting the requirements of successful societal functioning. The authors demonstrate, with data from Singapore and the United States, that correctly interpreting the value hierarchies of groups requires comparison with the pan-cultural normative baseline.

TI  - Values and Proenvironmental Behavior A Five-Country Survey
PY  - 1998
AB  - This multinational study examined the relationship between values, awareness of the consequences for environmental damage, ascribed responsibility, and proenvironmental behaviors. Survey data were collected from college students in Mexico (n = 187), Nicaragua (n = 78), Peru (n = 160), Spain (n = 187), and the United States (n = 345). Measures included items from Schwartz's values instrument, self-reported proenvironmental behaviors, ascribed responsibility, the New Environmental Paradigm, and demographics. Regression analyses revealed a positive relationship between items within self-transcendence (especially the environment-oriented items) and proenvironmental behavior in Mexico, Nicaragua, Spain, and the United States. Additional analyses provided partial support for the extension of Schwartz's model of norm-activation to proenvironmental behavior.

TI  - Evaluating replicability of factors in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory: Confirmatory factor analysis versus Procrustes rotation.
PY  - 1996
AB  - Despite the empirical robustness of the 5-factor model of personality, recent confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) of NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) data suggest they do not fit the hypothesized model. In a replication study of 229 adults, a series ofCFAs showed that Revised NEO-PI scales are not simple-structured but do approximate the normative 5-factor structure. CFA goodness-of-fit indices, however, were not high. Comparability analyses showed that no more than 5 factors were replicable, which calls into question some assumptions underlying the use of CFA. An alternative method that uses targeted rotation was presented and illustrated with data from Chinese and Japanese versions of the Revised NEO-PI that clearly replicated the 5-factor structure.

TI  - Social Value Orientations and Decisions to Take Proenvironmental Action1
PY  - 1998
AB  - This study assessed whether social value orientations influence decisions to actively support a proposal for a transportation pollution reduction program. Participants with prosocial or proself orientations were given the opportunity to send letters of support or opposition to the program director. Proself participants were more likely to send letters opposing the program, whereas prosocial participants were more likely to send letters of support. Although proself and prosocial participants reported equivalent support for the program and equivalent perceptions of the program's environmental benefits, proself participants reported higher perceptions of personal costs associated with the program. Social value orientations may lead to differences in environmental behaviors, primarily because of differences in perceptions of the personal costs incurred from engaging in these behaviors.

TI  - Balancing Personal Needs with Environmental Preservation: Identifying the Values that Guide Decisions in Ecological Dilemmas
PY  - 1994
AB  - A taxonomy of values that specifies three domains (i.e., economic, social, and universal) was developed and used to explore the influence personal values have on people's decisions when placed in ecological dilemmas. Hypothetical scenarios, which pitted economic need against environmental preservation, were used to elicit individual decisions. The influence of economic and social conditions was also experimentally tested. Results from 144 University students show that subjects who embrace a universal value orientation were consistently more prone to endorse environmentally protective actions than were economically-oriented subjects. The decisions of socially-oriented subjects varied according to the “social justice” aspect of the situation. Furthermore, only the decisions of economically-oriented subjects were influenced by changes in the economic condition of the situation. Implications for contending with current ecological dilemmas are discussed.

TI  - Value Orientations, Gender, and Environmental Concern:
PY  - 1993
AB  - A social-psychological model is developed to examine the proposition that environmentalism represents a new way of thinking. It presumes that action in support of environmental quality may derive from any of three value orientations: egoistic, social-altruistic, or biospheric, and that gender may be implicated in the relation between these orientations and behavior. Behavioral intentions are modeled as the sum across values of the strength of a value times the strength of beliefs about the consequences of environmental conditions for valued objects. Evidence from a survey of 349 college students shows that beliefs about consequences for each type of valued object independently predict willingness to take political action, but only beliefs about consequences for self reliably predict willingness to pay through taxes. This result is consistent with other recent findings from contingent valuation surveys. Women have stronger beliefs than men about consequences for self, others, and the biosphere, but there i...

TI  - Values, Environmental Concern, and Environmental Behavior A Study into Household Energy Use
PY  - 2004
AB  - In this study, the role of values in the field of household energy use is investigated by using the concept of quality of life (QOL). Importance judgments on 22 QOL aspects could be summarized into seven clearly interpretable value dimensions. The seven value dimensions and general and specific environmental concern contributed significantly to the explanation of policy support for government regulation and for market strategies aimed at managing environmental problems as well as to the explanation of the acceptability of specific home and transport energy-saving measures. In line with earlier research, home and transport energy use were especially related to sociodemographic variables like income and household size. These results show that it is relevant to distinguish between different measures of environmental impact and different types of environmental intent. Moreover, the results suggest that using only attitudinal variables, such as values, may be too limited to explain all types of environmental behavior.

TI  - Motivated decision making: Effects of activation and self-centrality of values on choices and behavior
PY  - 2002
AB  - Six studies examined the value-behavior relation and focused on motivational properties of values, the self, and value activation. Priming environmental values enhanced attention to and the weight of information related to those values, which resulted in environmentally friendly consumer choices. This only occurred if these values were central to the self-concept. Value-congruent choices were also found in response to countervalue behavior in an unrelated context. Donating behavior congruent with central altruistic values was found as a result of enhanced self-focus, thus demonstrating the importance of the self in the value-behavior relation. The external validity of the value-centrality measure and its distinction from attitudes were demonstrated in the prediction of voting. Values were thus found to give meaning to, energize, and regulate value-congruent behavior, but only if values were cognitively activated and central to the self.

TI  - VALUES AS PREDICTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES: EVIDENCE FOR CONSISTENCY ACROSS 14 COUNTRIES
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract A multinational study is reported on the relationship between values and attitudes. Environmental attitudes were measured using the revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP: Dunlap et al., 1992) and Thompson and Barton's (1994) ecocentrism–anthropocentrism scales. Other measures included gender, SES, religion, and Schwartz's (1994) universal values scale. Survey data were obtained from college students in 14 countries. A sample of 2160 participants was obtained through university contacts in each country. Results found support for the distinction between different types of environmental attitudes. Regression analyses revealed a consistent pattern of findings across countries. Scores on the NEP scale and the ecocentrism scale were predicted by universalism (positively), power (negatively), and tradition (negatively). In contrast, anthropocentric concerns were significantly related to benevolence (negatively), power (positively), tradition (positively), and security (positively). Overall, these findings support the value-basis theory of environmental attitudes.

TI  - Values and Behavior: Strength and Structure of Relations
PY  - 2003
AB  - Three studies address unresolved issues in value-behavior relations. Does the full range of different values relate to common, recurrent behaviors? Which values relate more strongly to behavior than others? Do relations among different values and behaviors exhibit a meaningful overall structure? If so, how to explain this? We find that stimulation and tradition values relate strongly to the behaviors that express them; hedonism, power, universalism, and self-direction values relate moderately; and security, conformity, achievement, and benevolence values relate only marginally. Additional findings suggest that these differences in value-behavior relations may stem from normative pressures to perform certain behaviors. Such findings imply that values motivate behavior, but the relation between values and behaviors is partly obscured by norms. Relations among behaviors, among values, and jointly among values and behavior exhibit a similar structure. The motivational conflicts and congruities postulated by t...

PY  - 2001
AB  - This study integrates social value orientation (Messick & McClintock, 1968) and the consideration of future consequences (CFC; Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, & Edwards, 1994) within the extended norm activation model of proenvironmental behaviour (Stern, Dietz, & Kalof, 1993). A survey of college students (N=161) revealed some preliminary support for the proposed model, using past and intended involvement in proenvironmental political behaviour as the primary outcome variables. Relative to proselfs, prosocials expressed stronger proenvironmental intentions and a stronger belief in the social consequences of environmental conditions. Relative to low CFCs, high CFCs expressed stronger proenvironmental intentions, greater involvement in proenvironmental behaviour, and a stronger belief in the personal, social and biospheric consequences of environmental conditions. Perceived consequences mediated the relationship between CFC and proenvironmental intentions and behaviour, and high CFCs evidence a stronger positive relationship between perceived social consequences and proenvironmental intentions.

TI  - Are There Universal Aspects in the Structure and Contents of Human Values
PY  - 1994
AB  - This article presents a theory of potentially universal aspects in the content of human values. Ten types of values are distinguished by their motivational goals. The theory also postulates a structure of relations among the value types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based on the theory and suitable for cross-cultural research, is described. Evidence relevant for assessing the theory, from 97 samples in 44 countries, is summarized. Relations of this approach to Rokeach's work on values and to other theories and research on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified in the domains of politics and intergroup relations.

PY  - 1999
AB  - Investigating whether benevolent or universalism value types are more closely related to social value orientations, a survey of 190 undergraduates elicited value priorities, social value orientations and preferences for cooperation in a social dilemma. In analyses of the value priorities a benevolence, a universalism and several individualistic value types were revealed. It was found that the priority ascribed to universalism but not to benevolence values successfully discriminated between participants whose social value orientations were classified as prosocial or proself. Almost as accurately as social value orientations, value priorities predicted preferences for cooperation in the social dilemma.

TI  - Predicting environmental attitudes and behavior
PY  - 2002
AB  - The need to explain the nature of the relationship between the people and the environment has contributed to widespread research. Out of this general framework, there is increasing focus on the structure of attitudes, beliefs and values in order to explain pro-environmental behaviour. This paper compares two approaches of pro-environmental behaviour prediction. One of them corresponds to the Schwartz’s norm activation theory (1977, 1992). The other was developed by Stern et al. (1995). The approaches predict pro-environmental behaviour through either personal norms or behavioural intention. In this study, general and specific attitudes and beliefs, as well as values, were used as predictors. The results of the present study support Stern’s approach and confirms that it one which can be helpful as an explanatory devise.

TI  - Moral Norms and Environmental Behavior: An Application of Schwartz's Norm-Activation Model to Yard Burning1
PY  - 1978
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine some conditions under which moral norms, i.e., respect for the health of others, would be expected to influence environmentally related behavior. In particular, using a model developed by Schwartz, the study was conducted to determine whether variation in awareness of consequences (AC) and ascription of responsibility (AR) were associated with yard-burning behavior. It was expected that respondents who were aware of the negative consequences which burning could have for other people, and who accepted responsibility for their burning and its consequences, would be less likely to burn yard or garden wastes than those who were unaware of these conditions. It was found that AR was significantly related to burning behavior, while AC had only a weak association with burning. Further, as expected from Schwartz's model, a significant interaction between AR, AC, and burning behavior was found. These findings are discussed and the usefulness of this type of model for understanding other environmental behaviors is considered.

TI  - New Environmental Theories: Toward a Coherent Theory of Environmentally Significant Behavior
PY  - 2000
AB  - This article develops a conceptual framework for advancing theories of environmentally significant individual behavior and reports on the attempts of the author’s research group and others to develop such a theory. It discusses definitions of environmentally significant behavior; classifies the behaviors and their causes; assesses theories of environmentalism, focusing especially on value-belief-norm theory; evaluates the relationship between environmental concern and behavior; and summarizes evidence on the factors that determine environmentally significant behaviors and that can effectively alter them. The article concludes by presenting some major propositions supported by available research and some principles for guiding future research and informing the design of behavioral programs for environmental protection. Recent developments in theory and research give hope for building the understanding needed to effectively alter human behaviors that contribute to environmental problems. This article develops a conceptual framework for the theory of environmentally significant individual behavior, reports on developments toward such a theory, and addresses five issues critical to building a theory that can inform efforts to promote proenvironmental behavior.

TI  - Car Versus Public Transportation? The Role of Social Value Orientations in a Real-Life Social Dilemma1
PY  - 1995
AB  - This research evaluates the role of social value orientations (i.e., preferences for distribution of outcomes for the self and others) in decisions as how to commute. It was proposed that the commuting situation could be viewed either as an environmental issue, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Prisoner’s Dilemma, or as an accessibility problem, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Chicken Dilemma. On the basis of interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978) it was predicted that people who are primarily concerned with the collective welfareprosocial individuals-would prefer commuting by public transportation when other commuters were expected to go by public transportation. On the other hand, it was hypothesized that people who are primarily concerned with their own well-beingproself individuals-would prefer commuting by public transportation when others were expected to go by car. The obtained findings were consistent with these expectations. Practical and theoretical implications regarding the link between social value orientations and environmentally relevant behavior will be discussed.

TI  - A Brief Inventory of Values
PY  - 1998
AB  - The authors present a brief inventory derived from Schwartz's 56-item instrument measuring the structure and content of human values. The inventory's four 3-item scales, measuring the major clusters called Self-Transcendence, Self-Enhancement, Openness to Change, and Conservation (or Traditional) values, all produce scores with acceptable reliability in two studies of pro-environmental attitudes and actions, and the brief inventory predicts those indicators nearly as well as much longer ones. The authors also present subscales of biospheric and altruistic values that can be used to assess whether Self-Transcendence values are differentiated in this way in special samples such as environmental activists. The brief inventory is suitable for use in survey research and other settings in which the longer instrument might be impractical.

TI  - Value Structures behind Proenvironmental Behavior
PY  - 2002
AB  - The purpose of the study was to test a hierarchical model of the effects of general values, environmental values, problem awareness, and personal norms on general proenvironmental behavior. The model starts with the effects of the relatively stable structures of general values and moves toward effects of more specific environmental values, environmental problem awareness, and personal norms. A personal norm was expected to mediate the effects of values and problem awareness on proenvironmental behavior. Survey data from a Swedish sample of 1,400 individuals were used in a path analysis to test the model, which was supported, and the results showed that the personal norm could be seen as derived from self-transcendent and ecocentric values and activated by problem awareness. The personal norm mediated the effects from general values, environmental values, and problem awareness on proenvironmental behavior.

TI  - Value Consensus and Importance A Cross-National Study
PY  - 2000
AB  - Societal value consensus has been widely discussed but rarely studied empirically. The authors developed a definition and an operational index for value consensus suitable for cross-national comparisons. They then generated and tested hypotheses concerning causal impacts of socioeconomic development and political democratization on both value importance and value consensus in a society. Data are from matched samples of teachers from 42 nations (N = 7,856) who completed a survey that measures 10 distinct types of values. Both development and democratization correlate positively with the importance of openness and self-transcendence values, and negatively with the importance of conservation and self-enhancement values. Development and democratization have opposite relations to value consensus, suppressing one another’s effects. Development increases overall value consensus, whereas democratization decreases it. Differences between effects on specific value types are discussed.

PY  - 1989
AB  - The basic thesis of the work is that environmental problems are only to be solved by people - people who will be required to make value judgements in conflicts that go beyond narrowly conceived human concerns. Thus people require not only an ethical system, but a way of conceiving the world and themselves such that the intrinsic value of life and nature is obvious, a system based on 'deep ecological principles'. The book encourages readers to identify their own series of such parameters - their own ecosophies. Ecology, Comunity and Lifestyle will appeal to philosophers, specialists working on environmental issues, and the more general reader who is interested in learning some of the foundational ideas of the rapidly expanding field of environmental philosophy.

TI  - A Value-Belief-Norm Theory of Support for Social Movements: The Case of Environmentalism
PY  - 1999
AB  - We present a theory of the basis of support for a social movement. Three types of support (citizenship actions, policy support and acceptance, and personal-sphere behaviors that accord with movement principles) are empirically distinct from each other and from committed activism. Drawing on theoretical work on values and norm-activation processes, we propose a value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of movement support. Individuals who accept a movement’s basic values, believe that valued objects are threatened, and believe that their actions can help restore those values experience an obligation (personal norm) for pro-movement action that creates a predisposition to provide support; the particular type of support that results is dependent on the individual’s capabilities and constraints. Data from a national survey of 420 respondents suggest that the VBN theory, when compared with other prevalent theories, offers the best available account of support for the environmental movement.

TI  - Non-Economic Motivation for Contingent Values: Rights and Attitudinal Beliefs in the Willingness To Pay for Environmental Improvements
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper reports on a national CVM survey administered in combination with a psychometric scale on pro-social environmental attitudes to test for non-economic motivations for WTP. The multi-item scale measures biospheric, altruistic, and egoistic motives, and analyzes their association with rights-based (deontological) and consequential (utilitarian) ethics. I test hypotheses concerning the existence of distinct value orientations, and the relationships between attitudes, ethics, protest bids, and WTP. Contrary to some recent claims based upon convenience samples, environmental attitudes are found to be significant in explaining intended WTP; this is associated with an egoistic motive and rights-based, rather than consequential, beliefs.

TI  - Ethical Motives and Charitable Contributions in Contingent Valuation: Empirical Evidence from Social Psychology and Economics
PY  - 2000
AB  - Contingent valuation of the environment has proven popular amongst environmental economists in recent years and has increased the role of monetary valuation in public policy. However, the underlying economic model of human psychology fails to explain why certain types of stated behaviour are observed. Thus, good scope exists for interdisciplinary research in the area of economics and psychology with regard to environmental valuation. A critical review is presented here of some recent research by social psychologists in the US attempting to explain stated behaviour in contingent valuation. Attitudinal scales have been used to analyse the role of ecocentric, biocentric and altruistic motives for giving. However, the research is shown to draw some potentially misleading conclusions and be unrepresentative of contingent valuation. Two recent economic studies using contingent valuation are then reported and shown to have identified non-economic motives for WTP. The complexity of value formation and expression is found to go far beyond that generally accepted by economic models. Greater consideration of the role played by attitudes and ethical considerations then becomes relevant to the interpretation of results being used in standard cost-benefit analysis and environmental policy.

TI  - Economic Preferences or Attitude Expressions?: An Analysis of Dollar Responses to Public Issues
PY  - 1999
AB  - Participants in contingent valuation surveys and jurors setting punitive damages in civil trials provide answers denominated in dollars. These answers are better understood as expressions of attitudes than as indications of economic preferences. Well-established characteristics of attitudes and of the core process of affective valuation explain several robust features of dollar responses: high correlations with other measures of attractiveness or aversiveness, insensitivity to scope, preference reversals, and the high variability of dollar responses relative to other measures of the same attitude.

TI  - Using surveys to value public goods : the contingent valuation method
PY  - 1989
AB  - Economists and others have long believed that by balancing the costs of such public goods as air quality and wilderness areas against their benefits, informed policy choices can be made. But the problem of putting a dollar value on cleaner air or water and other goods not sold in the marketplace has been a major stumbling block. Mitchell and Carson, for reasons presented in this book, argue that at this time the contingent valuation (CV) method offers the most promising approach for determining public willingness to pay for many public goods---an approach likely to succeed, if used carefully, where other methods may fail. The result of ten years of research by the authors aimed at assessing how surveys might best be used to value public goods validly and reliably, this book makes a major contribution to what constitutes best practice in CV surveys.

Mitchell and Carson begin by introducing the contingent valuation method, describing how it works and the nature of the benefits it can be used to measure, comparing it to other methods for measuring benefits, and examining the data-gathering technique on which it is based---survey research. Placing contingent valuation in the larger context of welfare theory, the authors examine how the CV method impels a deeper understanding of willingness-to-pay versus willingness-to-accept compensation measures, the possibility of existence values for public goods, the role of uncertainty in benefit valuation, and the question of whether a consumer goods market or a political goods market (referenda) should be emulated. In developing a CV methodology, the authors deal with issues of broader significance to survey research. Their model of respondent error is relevant to current efforts to frame a theory of response behavior and bias typology will interest those considering the cognitive aspects of answering survey questions.

Mitchell and Carson conclude that the contingent valuation method can obtain valid valuation information on public goods, but only if the method is applied in a way that addresses the potential sources of error and bias. They end their book by providing guidelines for CV practitioners, a list of questions that should be asked by any decision maker who wishes to use the findings of a CV study, and suggestions for new applications of contingent valuation. Additional features include a comprehensive bibliography of the CV literature and an appendix summarizing more than 100 CV studies.

TI  - Stated Willingness to Pay for Public Goods: A Psychological Perspective
PY  - 1993
AB  - In the contingent valuation method for the valuation of public goods, survey respondents are asked to indicate the amount they are willing to pay (WTP) for the provision of a good. We contrast economic and psychological analyses of WTP and describe a study in which respondents indicated their WTP to prevent or to remedy threats to public health or to the environment, attributed either to human or to natural causes. WTP was significantly higher when the cause of a harm was human, though the effect was not large. The means of WTP for 16 issues were highly correlated with the means of other measures of attitude, including a simple rating of the importance of the threat. The responses are better described as expressions of attitudes than as indications of economic value, contrary to the assumptions of the contingent valuation method.

TI  - Preferences, information and biodiversity preservation
PY  - 1995
AB  - This paper considers the nature of preferences for the preservation of biodiversity, and the extent to which individuals are well-informed about biodiversity. We present evidence that the elicitation of monetary bids to pay for biodiversity preservation, as required for cost-benefit analysis, fails as a measure of welfare changes due to the prevalence of preferences which neoclassical economics defines as lexicographic. That is, a significant proportion of individuals refuse to make trade-offs which require the substitution of biodiversity for other goods. In addition, we show that understanding of the biodiversity concept is extremely limited, raising concerns over a reliance on stated preferences, as revealed in contingent valuation studies, for decision-making on this issue. Results from two samples (students and the general public) are described.

TI  - Don't be satisfied, identify! Strengthening positive spillover by connecting pro-environmental behaviors to an “environmentalist” label
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Theoretically, performing pro-environmental behaviors can lead to positive spillover (increased future pro-environmental behaviors or strengthened environmental attitudes) by increasing someone's acceptance of an environmental self-identity, or negative spillover by alleviating guilt motivations which fuel some environmental actions. Labeling someone an “environmentalist” in connection to performance of pro-environmental behaviors could strengthen the positive spillover route through emphasizing environmental self-identity rather than guilt reduction. In Study 1, participants perceiving that they performed many pro-environmental behaviors reported greater environmental self-identity strengthening their environmental attitudes, but simultaneously reported a reduction in guilt weakening their environmental attitudes. Since both positive spillover and negative spillover routes were active, there was not a significant total spillover effect from pro-environmental behavior to environmental attitudes. In Study 2, however, labeling those who perceived they performed many pro-environmental behaviors as “environmentalists” led to stronger environmental self-identity with no simultaneous reduction of guilt, increasing the total positive spillover.

TI  - Do Investors Buy What They Know? Product Market Choices and Investment Decisions
PY  - 2012
AB  - This article shows that individuals' product market choices influence their investment decisions. Using microdata from the brokerage and automotive industries, we find a strong positive relation between customer relationship, ownership of a company, and size of the ownership stake. Investors are also more likely to purchase and less likely to sell shares of companies they frequent as customers. These effects are stronger for individuals with longer customer relationships. A merger-based natural experiment supports a causal interpretation of our results. We also find evidence of causality in the other direction: inheritances and gifts have an effect on individuals' patronage decisions. A setup in which customer-investors regard stocks as consumption goods, not just as investments, seems to best explain our results. (JEL G11, G24, D83) The Author 2012.

TI  - Ethics and economic affairs - Ethics and Economic Affairs
PY  - 2002
AB  - There has been a remarkable growth of interest in the ethical dimension of economic affairs. Whilst the interest in business ethics has been long-standing, it has been given renewed emphasis by high profile scandals in the world of business and finance. At the same time many economists, dissatisfied with the discipline's emphasis on self-interest and individualism, and by the asocial nature of much economic theory, have sought to enlarge the scope of economics by looking at ethical questions. In this volume a group of interdisciplinary scholars provide contributions which include evaluations of work in business ethics, empirical studies of such issues as social and ethical investing, the place of ethics in the new economics and perspectives from other disciplines.

TI  - Which is the Fair Sex? Gender Differences in Altruism
PY  - 2001
AB  - We study gender differences in altruism by examining a modieed dictator game with varying incomes and prices. Our results indicate that the question “which is the fair sex?” has a complicated answer—when altruism is expensive, women are kinder, but when it is cheap, men are more altruistic. That is, we end that the male and female “demand curves for altruism” cross, and that men are more responsive to price changes. Furthermore, men are more likely to be either perfectly selesh or perfectly seleess, whereas women tend to be “equalitarians” who prefer to share evenly.

TI  - “Green to be seen” and “brown to keep down”: Visibility moderates the effect of identity on pro-environmental behavior
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Social identities predict pro-environmental behavior, but the strength may depend on whether the behavior is visible to others. When an environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior such as carrying reusable grocery bags, being observed by others may motivate signaling the valued group membership and may increase behavior (“green to be seen”). When an anti-environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior that signals an unwanted social identity, being observed may lead to less behavior (“brown to keep down”). United States residents completed three correlational surveys (total N = 1126) of identity, visibility, and self-reported behavior frequency using the Recurring Pro-environmental Behavior Scale. Three multilevel studies revealed that environmentalist identity predicted pro-environmental behavior more strongly for high-visibility behaviors, controlling for confounds at the person level (attitudes, political identity) and the behavior level (difficulty, effectiveness). This research helps uncover the key social identities and contextual factors that lead individuals to embrace or reject pro-environmental behaviors.

TI  - Why Social Preferences Matter - The Impact of Non-Selfish Motives on Competition, Cooperation and Incentives
PY  - 2002
AB  - A substantial number of people exhibit social preferences, which means they are not solely motivated by material self-interest but also care positively or negatively for the material payoffs of relevant reference agents. We show empirically that economists fail to understand fundamental economic questions when they disregard social preferences, in particular, that without taking social preferences into account, it is not possible to understand adequately (i) effects of competition on market outcomes, (ii) laws governing cooperation and collective action, (iii) effects and the determinants of material incentives, (iv) which contracts and property rights arrangements are optimal, and (v) important forces shaping social norms and market failures.

TI  - Gender and Environmental Concern: Insights from Recent Work and for Future Research
PY  - 2014
AB  - Research on environmental concern in the past few decades consistently finds that women express slightly greater environmental concern than men. This pattern is robust across samples, nations, time, and facets of environmental concern measured. In a recent suite of articles analyzing data from a few nationally representative data sets for the U.S. general public, we examine explanations for gender differences in environmental concern derived from gender socialization theory. We explain our key findings here, before providing five insights for supporting a comprehensive research agenda on gender and environmental concern. These range from specific suggestions on conceptual measurement and analytical techniques to more general ones for improving our social science data infrastructure.

AB  - This paper presents an experimentally validated survey module to measure six key economic preferences - risk aversion, discounting, trust, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity - in a reliable, parsimonious and cost-effective way. The survey instruments included in the module were the best predictors of preferences revealed in incentivized choice experiments. We also offer a streamlined version of the module that has been optimized and piloted for applications where time efficiency and simplicity are paramount, such as international telephone surveys.

TI  - Social Identity and the Service-Profit Chain
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The conventional service–profit chain (SPC) proposes that a firm's financial performance can be improved through a path that connects employee satisfaction, customer orientation, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. In this article, a complementary SPC that is built on both a conventional path and a social identity–based path is introduced. The latter SPC path centrally builds on customer– and employee–company identification as a core construct. Using a large-scale triadic data set that includes data from employees, customers, and firms, the authors find strong support for the extended SPC, which accounts for important customer (loyalty and willingness to pay) and firm (financial performance) outcomes. In addition, the effects of company identification exist incrementally beyond the effects of the conventional SPC path.

TI  - Investor Competence, Trading Frequency, and Home Bias
PY  - 2009
AB  - People are more willing to bet on their own judgments when they feel skillful or knowledgeable. We investigate whether this “competence effect” influences trading frequency and home bias. We find that investors who feel competent trade more often and have more internationally diversified portfolios. We also find that male investors, and investors with larger portfolios or more education, are more likely to perceive themselves as competent than are female investors, and investors with smaller portfolios or less education. Our paper also contributes to understanding the theoretical link between overconfidence and trading frequency. Existing theories on trading frequency have focused on one aspect of overconfidence, i.e., miscalibration. Our paper offers a potential mechanism for the “better-than-average” aspect of overconfidence to influence trading frequency. In the context of our paper, overconfident investors tend to perceive themselves to be more competent, and thus are more willing to act on their beliefs, leading to higher trading frequency.

TI  - What we say and what we do: the relationship between real and hypothetical moral choices.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Moral ideals are strongly ingrained within society and individuals alike, but actual moral choices are profoundly influenced by tangible rewards and consequences. Across two studies we show that real moral decisions can dramatically contradict moral choices made in hypothetical scenarios (Study 1). However, by systematically enhancing the contextual information available to subjects when addressing a hypothetical moral problem—thereby reducing the opportunity for mental simulation—we were able to incrementally bring subjects’ responses in line with their moral behaviour in real situations (Study 2). These results imply that previous work relying mainly on decontextualized hypothetical scenarios may not accurately reflect moral decisions in everyday life. The findings also shed light on contextual factors that can alter how moral decisions are made, such as the salience of a personal gain.

TI  - Doing Good or Doing Well? Image Motivation and Monetary Incentives in Behaving Prosocially
PY  - 2009
AB  - Most charitable organizations depend on private contributions, in the form of monetary gifts, volunteer efforts, or other tangible contributions, such as blood donations. The magnitude of private contributions is impressive?in the United States 89 percent of households donate, aver? aging $1,620 per year, and 44 percent of US adults volunteer the equivalent of 9 million full time jobs (Independent Sector 2001). This level of prosocial behavior is striking in light of the economic incentive to free-ride in the provision of public goods. In order to elicit contributions, charitable organizations use many creative efforts to incentivize voluntary giving: wrist bands, thank-you gifts, organized walks, concerts, and advertised donors lists. The government also helps promote charitable giving by offering tax breaks for donations. The various types of charitable contributions and the many real-life ways of soliciting such donations suggest that there may be different motives for individuals to behave prosocially. These motives are roughly divisible into three broad categories: intrinsic, extrinsic, and image motiva? tion. Intrinsic motivation is the value of giving per se, represented by private preferences for others' well-being, such as pure altruism or other forms of prosocial preferences (for surveys, see Ernst Fehr and Klaus Schmidt 2003; Meier 2007). Extrinsic motivation is any material reward or benefit associated with giving, such as thank-you gestures and tax breaks. Image motivation, or signaling motivation, refers to an individual's tendency to be motivated partly by others' percep? tions. Image motivation therefore captures the rule of opinion in utility, i.e., the desire to be liked and respected by others and by one's self. If individuals are looking to gain social approval of their behavior, they should try to signal traits defined as "good" based on the community's norms

TI  - Lost in translation: Exploring the ethical consumer intention–behavior gap
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ethical consumerism is a burgeoning movement, yet ethically-minded consumers rarely purchase ethically. Understanding obstacles to ethical consumption is limited. This study explores the underlying mechanics of the ethical purchase intention–behavior gap in the context of consumers' daily lives. The study employs multiple qualitative methods across multiple sites, explores the intention–behavior gap in observed modes of shopping behavior, and uses an interpretive approach. The analysis reveals four interrelated factors affecting the ethical intention–behavior gap: (1) prioritization of ethical concerns; (2) formation of plans/habits; (3) willingness to commit and sacrifice; and (4) modes of shopping behavior. Awareness of these four factors provides both strategic and tactical implications for marketing managers seeking to reach the elusive ethical consumer. Understanding and enhancing ethical consumption – closing the gap – has positive outcomes for the future sustainability of economies, societies and environments.

TI  - Is Unbiased Financial Advice to Retail Investors Sufficient? Answers from a Large Field Study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Working with one of the largest brokerages in Germany, we record what happens when unbiased investment advice is offered to a random set of approximately 8,000 active retail customers out of the brokerage's several hundred thousand retail customers. We find that investors who most need the financial advice are least likely to obtain it. The investors who do obtain the advice (about 5%), however, hardly follow the advice and do not improve their portfolio efficiency by much. Overall, our results imply that the mere availability of unbiased financial advice is a necessary but not sufficient condition for benefiting retail investors. The Author 2012.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED AND ACTUAL FINANCIAL LITERACY ON FINANCIAL BEHAVIORS
PY  - 2015
AB  - A combined measure of financial literacy that includes both a test score of actual financial literacy and a self-rating of overall financial literacy is used in this study. We find that the combined measure appears to provide greater understanding about how financial literacy affects financial behaviors. A large national survey of U.S. adults and households (n = 28,146) was used to investigate how this overall financial literacy is likely to change financial behaviors across five financial topics: credit cards, investments, loans, insurance, and financial advice. For each topic, we include 4–5 financial behaviors (22 in total) to demonstrate the consistency of the findings within and across topics. Although we are unable to identify a causal relationship, the results from the probit analysis show that both actual and perceived financial literacy appear to influence financial behaviors and that perceived financial literacy may be as important as actual financial literacy.

TI  - Are Women Less Selfish Than Men?: Evidence From Dictator Experiments
PY  - 1998
AB  - Research in social sciences other than economics indicates substan tial differences in behaviour between men and women. The general conclusion drawn from this work is that women will be more socially-orientated (selfless), and men more individually-orientated (selfish). This paper reports the results of a double-anonymous dictator experiment designed to permit the emergence of basic gender differences in economic behaviour. Our results are intended to provide a baseline for further research. We find that women, on average, donate twice as much as men to their anonymous partners when any factors that might confound cooperation are eliminated

TI  - Developing a Trichotomy Model to Measure Socially Responsible Behaviour in China
PY  - 2011
AB  - Since the Chinese government advocated a Harmonious Society, socially responsible consumption has increased and companies are responding to the trend. However, our understanding of the attitude and behaviour of 1.3 billion Chinese consumers on socially responsible consumption is almost blank. The primary objective of the present study is to develop a scale to measure socially responsible consumer behaviour (SRCB) in China's Taoist context. The secondary objective is to identify whether Chinese consumers share the same ecological and social concerns with their western counterparts as previous research suggests. This paper starts with a new definition of SRCB based on a literature review, then identifies the dimensions of SRCB in China on the basis of in-depth interviews and previous findings. Finally, a nine-factor, 34-item scale is developed through a widely used scale-building process. Differences with findings from the US and France are discussed and marketing implications are elaborated.

TI  - Do consumers really care about corporate responsibility? Highlighting the attitude—behaviour gap
PY  - 2000
AB  - According to the press at the turn of the year 1999—2000, a good corporate reputation for responsible marketing is a key element in business success. One justification for this is the assumption that consumers are interested in how companies behave and this has an influence upon their consumption behaviour. There is also the suggestion that a financial pay‐off is to be gained from good behaviour. Conflicting reports in previous research cast doubt upon the reliability of these assumptions, and there are few studies which unequivocally support positive consumer purchasing in return for responsible marketing. This paper reviews current opinion and evidence in relation to the growing interest in corporate reputation, and reports findings from focus group research which casts doubt upon the efficacy of corporate reputation in influencing positive consumer purchase behaviour.

TI  - Robo-Advisors versus Traditional Investment Advisors: An Unequal Game
PY  - 2018
AB  - To obtain diversified market exposure, a passive implementation of an investment strategy is generally cheaper, more efficient, and more transparent and thus a preferred way to invest for cost-sensitive clients. Robo-advisors will not only become the preferred investment solution for retail clients but will also gain importance in the affluent and high-net-worth individual segments. Through cooperation with fintech companies or acquisition of innovative technology, robo-advice could become an increasingly important element for traditional banks and wealth managers.

TI  - The Sustainability Wage Gap
PY  - 2021
AB  - We document a new channel through which a firm’s sustainability policies can contribute positively to its bottom line, by reducing labor costs and by enabling firms to recruit and retain workers that are highly skilled. Using detailed administrative employer-employee matched data from Sweden and a novel measure that quantifies the environmental sustainability of different economic activities, we document that workers earn about 10% lower wages in firms that operate in more sustainable sectors. We refer to this empirical regularity as the Sustainability Wage Gap. Exploiting heterogeneities in workers’ preferences for sustainable jobs, we show that the wage gap is larger for high-skilled workers, especially those with high non-cognitive skills, and increasing over time. We argue that our results are difficult to reconcile with many alternative interpretations suggested in prior research.

TI  - Ethically Minded Consumer Behavior:Scale Review, Development, and Validation
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper details the development and validation of a new research instrument called the Ethically Minded Consumer Behavior (EMCB) scale. The scale conceptualizes ethically minded consumer behavior as a variety of consumption choices pertaining to environmental issues and corporate social responsibility. Developed and extensively tested among consumers (n= 1278) in the UK, Germany, Hungary, and Japan, the scale demonstrates reliability, validity, and metric measurement invariance across these diverse nations. The study provides researchers and practitioners with a much needed and easy to administer, valid, and reliable instrument pertaining to ethically minded consumer behavior.

TI  - Who are robo-advisor users?
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the demand for robo-advising services by analyzing the participants’ behavioral characteristics and investment patterns. With the 2015 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor data, we found that robo-advisor users were younger investors with high risk tolerance, whose self-assessment of financial knowledge is comparatively higher than their actual knowledge, and were independent decision-makers. By controlling for those behavioral attributes of robo-advisor users, we also found that robo-advisor users were reluctant to invest in individual stocks, while they showed the largest preference for investing in pooled investment products such as Exchange Traded Funds. Implications of this study’s findings can be beneficial to financial planning practitioners, academics, and regulators.

TI  - The Promises and Pitfalls of Robo-Advising
PY  - 2019
AB  - We study the introduction of a wealth-management robo-adviser that constructs portfolios tailored to investors’ holdings and preferences. Adopters are similar to non-adopters in terms of demographics and prior interactions with human advisers but tend to be more active and have greater assets under management. Investors adopting robo-advising experience diversification benefits. Ex ante undiversified investors increase stock holdings and hold portfolios with less volatility and better returns. Already well-diversified investors hold fewer stocks, yet see some reduction in volatility, and trade more after adoption. All investors increase attention based on online account logins. We find that adopters exhibit declines in prominent behavioral biases, including the disposition, trend chasing, and rank effect. Our results emphasize the promises and pitfalls of robo-advising tools, which are becoming ubiquitous all over the world.Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision August 21, 2018 by Editor Wei Jiang.

TI  - Financial advice and bank profits
PY  - 2018
AB  - We use a unique data set from a large retail bank containing internal managerial Accounting data on revenues and costs per client to analyze how banks and their financial advisors generate profits with customers. We find that advised transactions are associated with higher profits than independently executed trades of the same client. The bank’s own mutual funds and structured products are most profitable for the bank, and profits increase with trade size. We show that advisors recommend exactly those transactions. Furthermore, we find that advised clients achieve a worse performance than independent clients, suggesting that advisors put their employer’s interest first.

TI  - Licensing Effect in Consumer Choice
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Most choices in the real world follow other choices or judgments. The authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation. The authors also report a mediation analysis in support of their theoretical explanation that the licensing effect operates by providing a temporary boost in the relevant self-concept.

TI  - A de-biased direct question approach to measuring consumers' willingness to pay
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Knowledge of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) is a prerequisite to profitable price-setting. To gauge consumers' WTP, practitioners often rely on a direct single question approach in which consumers are asked to explicitly state their WTP for a product. Despite its popularity among practitioners, this approach has been found to suffer from hypothetical bias. In this paper, we propose a rigorous method that improves the accuracy of the direct single question approach. Specifically, we systematically assess the hypothetical biases associated with the direct single question approach and explore ways to de-bias it. Our results show that by using the de-biasing procedures we propose, we can generate a de-biased direct single question approach that is accurate enough to be useful for managerial decision-making. We validate this approach with two studies in this paper.

TI  - Precautionary savings, retirement planning and misperceptions of financial literacy
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract We measure financial literacy among LinkedIn members, complementing standard questions with additional questions that allow us to gauge self-perceptions of financial literacy. Average financial literacy is surprisingly low given the demographics of our sample: fewer than two-thirds of chief financial officers, chief executive officers, and chief operating officers complete the test correctly. Financial literacy, precautionary savings and retirement planning are positively correlated, but this is mostly driven by perceived, not actual, literacy: controlling for self-perceptions, actual literacy has low predictive power. Perceptions drive decision-making among low-literacy respondents and are associated with mistaken beliefs about financial products and less willingness to accept financial advice.

TI  - Developing a Trichotomy Model to Measure Socially Responsible Behaviour in China
PY  - 2011
AB  - <jats:p> Since the Chinese government advocated a Harmonious Society, socially responsible consumption has increased and companies are responding to the trend. However, our understanding of the attitude and behaviour of 1.3 billion Chinese consumers on socially responsible consumption is almost blank. The primary objective of the present study is to develop a scale to measure socially responsible consumer behaviour (SRCB) in China's Taoist context. The secondary objective is to identify whether Chinese consumers share the same ecological and social concerns with their western counterparts as previous research suggests. This paper starts with a new definition of SRCB based on a literature review, then identifies the dimensions of SRCB in China on the basis of in-depth interviews and previous findings. Finally, a nine-factor, 34-item scale is developed through a widely used scale-building process. Differences with findings from the US and France are discussed and marketing implications are elaborated. </jats:p>

TI  - Financial Literacy Around the World: An Overview
PY  - 2011
AB  - In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less literate than others. Moreover, the more financially literate are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.

TI  - Paying to Be Nice: Consistency and Costly Prosocial Behavior
PY  - 2012
AB  - Building on previous research in economics and psychology, we propose that the costliness of initial prosocial behavior positively influences whether that behavior leads to consistent future behaviors. We suggest that costly prosocial behaviors serve as a signal of prosocial identity and that people subsequently behave in line with that self-perception. In contrast, costless prosocial acts do not signal much about one's prosocial identity, so subsequent behavior is less likely to be consistent and may even show the reductions in prosocial behavior associated with licensing. The results of a laboratory experiment and a large field experiment converge to support our account.

TI  - Is Conflicted Investment Advice Better than No Advice
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The benefit of investment advice depends on the quality of advice and the investor's counterfactual portfolio. We use changes in the Oregon University System Optional Retirement Plan to highlight the impact of plan design on the counterfactual portfolios of advice seekers. When brokers are available and target date funds (TDFs) are not, brokers help participants with high predicted demand for advice bear market risk, but they recommend higher-commission options. When brokers are removed and TDFs are added, new high-predicted-demand participants primarily invest in TDFs, which offer similar market risk but higher Sharpe ratios than the broker-advised portfolios within our sample.

TI  - Fairness in Markets and Market Experiments
PY  - NA
AB  - Whether pro-social preferences identified in economic laboratories survive in natural market contexts is an important and contested issue. We investigate how fairness in a laboratory experiment framed explicitly as a market exchange relates to preferences for fair trade products before and after the market experiment. We find that the willingness to buy at a higher price when higher wages are paid to the worker correlates both with the choice for a fair trade product before the laboratory experiment and with whether the participants are willing to pay a positive fair trade premium, elicited at the end of the experiment. These results support the notion that fairness preferences as assessed in laboratory experiments capture preferences for fair behavior in comparable situations outside the laboratory.

PY  - 2020
AB  - This study investigates the financial attributes, financial behaviors, financial‐advisor‐use beliefs, and investing characteristics associated with having used an automated investment solution (i.e., a robo‐advisor). Data are used from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (both the State‐by‐State Survey and the Investor Survey) to investigate the use of robo‐advisors among 1,393 individuals with non‐retirement investment accounts. Multivariable results indicated that being younger, having low or midrange income, and having lower objective investment‐knowledge scores was positively associated with robo‐advisor use. This study provides important insight for policymakers, financial practitioners, and proprietors of robo‐advisors and other fintech products.

TI  - Talk and Action: What Individual Investors Say and What They Do
PY  - 2005
AB  - Combining survey responses and trading records of clients of a German retail broker, this paper examines some of the causes for the apparent failure to buy and hold a well-diversified portfolio. The subjective investor attributes gleaned from the survey help explain the variation in actual portfolio and trading choices. Self-reported risk aversion is the single most important determ- inant of both portfolio diversification and turnover; other things equal, investors who report being more risk tolerant hold less diversified portfolios and trade more aggressively. Less experienced investors similarly tend to churn poorly diversified portfolios. The effect of perceived knowledge on portfolio choice is less clear cut; holding other attributes constant, investors who think themselves knowledgeable about financial securities indeed hold better diversified portfolios, but those who think themselves more knowledgeable than the average investor churn their portfolios more.

TI  - Paying To Be Good? U.K. Ethical Investments
PY  - 1992
AB  - Ethical investing raises questions relating both to the possibility of private provision of public goods and to the determination of asset prices in financial markets. In both cases, economists have turned.to more complex, psychologically based models of behavior to provide adequate explanations. Such models show that there is unlikely to be a clearly identifiable cost to ethical investment and suggest the need for closer consideration of the diversity of investors' motives. The discussion is illustrated by reference to the growth and performance of U.K. ethical investments. Copyright 1992 by WWZ and Helbing & Lichtenhahn Verlag AG

The authors also briefly explore possibilities for further conceptual and empirical study of moral aspects of counseling and psychotherapy.

TI  - On the social psychology of the stock market: Aggregate attributional effects and the regressiveness of prediction.
PY  - 1987
AB  - The expectation that changes will either persist or regress to previous levels depends in large part on whether causal attributions are provided to explain recent changes. If these attributions are provided, then the tendency to make regressive predictions is diminished. It is argued that the news media provide such attributions and so cause aggregate-level changes in the predictions of those who receive these communications and thereby in receivers' subsequent behaviors. Causal attributions by members of the media should be expected to be more frequent and more extreme than those that would be generated by individuals who do not expect to communicate information to others. This aggregate attributional process, whereby one group acts on the attributions provided by another, is illustrated in financial markets. First, this research shows that the financial press explains recent changes in stock prices with good news after price rises and with bad news after price falls. In an experimental study, such news is shown to lead to less regressive predictions. The normative and theoretical implications of the results for economic and psychological processes are discussed.

TI  - Morals and Markets: Some Theoretical and Policy Implications of Ethical Investing
PY  - 1998
AB  - Margaret Thatcher was fond of retelling the parable of the Good Samaritan. In her version the main point was not only that the Good Samaritan was shown to be putting into practice neighbourly concern, but also that he had the money so to do. By implication, a government prepared to restrain public expenditure and reduce taxation is handing moral responsibility for the provision of welfare back to individuals. With a reduced tax burden, the government can be seen as empowering people to put their money where their morals are, which they may exhibit by giving to charity and making provision, through private insurance and savings schemes, for schooling, future health needs, and retirement.

TI  - Values, Ethics and Ecology in Economics
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper discusses the ways in which mainstream (i.e. neo‐classical) economics lacks to adequately take into account ethical motivations and concerns, at various levels. It also points out, by contrast, what could be more appropriate ways to start incorporating these considerations into economic thinking. The ideological optimism and the (at best) very limited questioning of most mainstream literature is pointed out at the beginning, followed by a methodological discussion of the “rational choice” paradigm that highlights the distance between theoretical assumptions (and results) and reality. These assumptions and methodology are then contrasted with some (pretty robust) results from economic experiments that show the relevance of notions of fairness, or kindness, in interpreting actual (though experimental) economic behaviour. Experiments also highlight the significance of individual differences (heterogeneity) in economic behaviour. One of the main foundations for such differences is the individual va...

TI  - The Effects of Advertising on High and Low Loyalty Consumer Segments
PY  - 1982
AB  - Different advertising effects on purchase behavior of consumers of varying brand loyalty are investigated. In a frequently purchased product class, consumers of high loyalty increase brand and product purchase when advertising for that brand increases. Little switching occurs from competitive brands into the advertised brand. At low loyalties there is little impact. Effects of increased advertising carry over for a few months after advertising is lowered back to normal levels.

TI  - The sunk cost and Concorde effects: Are humans less rational than lower animals?
PY  - 1999
AB  - The sunk cost effect is a maladaptive economic behavior that is manifested in a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made. The Concorde fallacy is another name for the sunk cost effect, except that the former term has been applied strictly to lower animals, whereas the latter has been applied solely to humans. The authors contend that there are no unambiguous instances of the Concorde fallacy in lower animals and also present evidence that young children, when placed in an economic situation akin to a sunk cost one, exhibit more normatively correct behavior than do adults. These findings pose an enigma: Why do adult humans commit an error contrary to the normative cost-benefit rules of choice, whereas children and phylogenetically humble organisms do not? The authors attempt to show that this paradoxical state of affairs is due to humans' overgeneralization of the "Don't waste" rule. The sunk cost effect is a maladaptive economic behavior that is manifested in a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made (Arkes & Blumer, 1985). A prior investment should not influence one's consideration of current options; only the incremental costs and benefits of the current options should influence one's decision. Nevertheless, several researchers have shown that people do attend to prior investments as they consider what course of action to take. For example, Arkes and Blumer (1985, Experiment 2) arranged to have three different types of season tickets sold to persons who approached the Ohio University Theater ticket booth at the beginning of the season. Approximately one third of the patrons purchased season tickets at the full $15 price, one third at $13, and one third at $8. Compared with those who purchased tickets at $15, those who purchased tickets at either of the discounted prices attended fewer plays during the subsequent 6 months. Apparently, those who had "sunk" the most money into the season tickets were most motivated to use the tickets. This is contrary to the maxim that incremental costs and benefits should govern one's decision to attend the plays. Once the tickets had been purchased, all patrons had a license to attend any play. Presumably, the costs and benefits of theater attendance would have been equal for the members of all

TI  - Sustainable consumer behavior
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Most agree that climate change is a serious threat. It has increasingly been recognized by scientists and policymakers as a consumer behavior issue: What, how, and how much people consume directly impacts the environment. Sustainable consumer behavior is behavior that attempts to satisfy present needs while simultaneously benefiting or limiting environmental impact. Moreover, understanding sustainable consumer behavior is central to any paradigm shifts in how society approaches environmental problems. This article summarizes and organizes research from the past 20 years and explores the psychological drivers of sustainable consumer behavior. Four areas of scientific inquiry that have dominated research agendas are identified: (a) cognitive barriers, (b) the self, (c) social influence, and (d) product characteristics. The objective is to provide a valuable research tool that stimulates additional research in the area of sustainable consumer behavior.</jats:p>

TI  - A Psychological Study of the Inverse Relationship Between Perceived Risk and Perceived Benefit
PY  - 1994
AB  - Judgments of risk and judgments of benefit have been found to be inversely related. Activities or technologies that are judged high in risk tend to be judged low in benefit, and vice versa. In the present study, we examine this inverse relationship in detail, using two measures of relationship between risk and benefit. We find that the inverse relationship is robust and indicative of a confounding of risk and benefit in people's minds. This confounding is linked to a person's overall evaluation of an activity or technology. Theoretical and practical implications of this risk-benefit confounding are discussed.

TI  - Regression Discontinuity Inference with Specification Error
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract A regression discontinuity (RD) research design is appropriate for program evaluation problems in which treatment status (or the probability of treatment) depends on whether an observed covariate exceeds a fixed threshold. In many applications the treatment-determining covariate is discrete. This makes it impossible to compare outcomes for observations “just above” and “just below” the treatment threshold, and requires the researcher to choose a functional form for the relationship between the treatment variable and the outcomes of interest. We propose a simple econometric procedure to account for uncertainty in the choice of functional form for RD designs with discrete support. In particular, we model deviations of the true regression function from a given approximating function—the specification errors—as random. Conventional standard errors ignore the group structure induced by specification errors and tend to overstate the precision of the estimated program impacts. The proposed inference procedure that allows for specification error also has a natural interpretation within a Bayesian framework.

TI  - Individual and Corporate Social Responsibility
PY  - 2009
AB  - Society's demands for individual and corporate social responsibility as alternative responses to market and distributive failures are becoming increasingly prominent. We draw on recent developments in the psychology and economics of prosocial behaviour to shed light on this trend and the underlying mix of motivations. We then link individual concerns to corporate social responsibility, contrasting three possible understandings of the term: firms' adoption of a more long-term perspective, the delegated exercise of prosocial behaviour on behalf of stakeholders, and insider-initiated corporate philanthropy. We discuss the benefits, costs and limits of socially responsible behaviour as a means to further societal goals.

TI  - Risk as feelings.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Virtually all current theories of choice under risk or uncertainty are cognitive and consequentialist. They assume that people assess the desirability and likelihood of possible outcomes of choice alternatives and integrate this information through some type of expectation-based calculus to arrive at a decision. The authors propose an alternative theoretical perspective, the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, that highlights the role of affect experienced at the moment of decision making. Drawing on research from clinical, physiological, and other subfields of psychology, they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs, emotional reactions often drive behavior. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive-consequentialist terms.

PY  - 2012
AB  - We investigate the role of identity and self-image consideration under “pay-what-you-want” pricing. Results from three field experiments show that often, when granted the opportunity to name the price of a product, fewer consumers choose to buy it than when the price is fixed and low. We show that this opt-out behavior is driven largely by individuals’ identity and self-image concerns; individuals feel bad when they pay less than the “appropriate” price, causing them to pass on the opportunity to purchase the product altogether.

TI  - Robust Nonparametric Confidence Intervals for Regression‐Discontinuity Designs
PY  - 2014
AB  - In the regression-discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large” bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature. All results are readily available in R and STATA using our companion software packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, 2014b).

TI  - SRI Funds: Investor Demand, Exogenous Shocks and ESG Profiles
PY  - 2016
AB  - We provide evidence that investor demand for socially responsible or sustainable and responsible (SRI) mutual funds differs from that of conventional funds in that flows to SRI funds have shown greater growth and more persistence than flows to conventional funds. More importantly, using a differences-in-differences approach we provide evidence that these attributes appear to result from investors’ nonfinancial considerations. However, as these funds have become more mainstream, there has been convergence in investor resilience. We also find a high level of persistence in SRI funds' ESG profiles, which are generally different from those of conventional funds, consistent with their charters.

TI  - The Motivating Role of Dissociative Out-Groups in Encouraging Positive Consumer Behaviors
PY  - 2014
AB  - Previous research has found that people tend to avoid products or behaviors that are linked to dissociative reference groups. The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer's group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together...

PY  - 2011
AB  - We studied the perception of wealth as a function of varying levels of assets and debt. We found that with total wealth held constant, people with positive net worth feel and are seen as wealthier when they have lower debt (despite having fewer assets). In contrast, people with equal but negative net worth feel and are considered wealthier when they have greater assets (despite having larger debt). This pattern persists in the perception of both the self and others. We explore consequences for the willingness to borrow and lend and briefly discuss the policy implications of these findings.

TI  - Salience Theory of Choice Under Risk
PY  - 2012
AB  - We present a theory of choice among lotteries in which the decision maker's attention is drawn to (precisely defined) salient payoffs. This leads the decision maker to a context-dependent representation of lotteries in which true probabilities are replaced by decision weights distorted in favor of salient payoffs. By endogenizing decision weights as a function of payoffs, our model provides a novel and unified account of many empirical phenomena, including frequent risk-seeking behavior, invariance failures such as the Allais paradox, and preference reversals. It also yields new predictions, including some that distinguish it from Prospect Theory, which we test. We also use the model to modify the standard asset pricing framework, and use that application to explore the well-known growth/value anomaly in finance.

TI  - Doing Poorly by Doing Good: Corporate Social Responsibility and Brand Concepts
PY  - 2012
AB  - Although the idea of brand concepts has been around for a while, very little research addresses how brand concepts may influence consumer responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Four studies reveal that communicating the CSR actions of a luxury brand concept causes a decline in evaluations, relative to control. A luxury brand’s self-enhancement concept (i.e., dominance over people and resources) is in conflict with the CSR information’s self-transcendence concept (i.e., protecting the welfare of all), which causes disfluency and a decline in evaluations. These effects do not emerge for brands with openness (i.e., following emotional pursuits in uncertain directions) or conservation (i.e., protecting the status quo) concepts that do not conflict with CSR. The effects for luxury brand concepts disappeared when the informativeness of the disfluency was undermined but were accentuated in an abstract (vs. concrete) mind-set. These findings implicate brand concepts as a key factor in how ...

When evaluating the outcome of completed experiences, people are sensitive to the magnitude of component (i.e., gross) gains and losses rather than responding solely to the net outcomes. However, people do not consistently favor outcomes that minimize losses (a pattern consistent with loss aversion), nor those that maximize gains (a pattern consistent with a positivity bias). Instead, preferences are context dependent. Holding net outcomes constant, people prefer positive outcomes that have lower magnitudes of component gains and losses. In contrast, people prefer negative outcomes that have higher magnitudes of component gains and losses. A shift in focus occurs such that people prioritize the contrasting attribute (e.g., negative when the net outcome is positive) in the evaluation process. The article concludes by discussing implications for a broad range of judgments and decisions. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing Better? Consumer Reactions to Corporate Social Responsibility
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract In the face of marketplace polls that attest to the increasing influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on consumers’ purchase behavior, this article examines when, how, and for whom specific CSR initiatives work. The findings implicate both company-specific factors, such as the CSR issues a company chooses to focus on and the quality of its products, and individual-specific factors, such as consumers’ personal support for the CSR issues and their general beliefs about CSR, as key moderators of consumers’ responses to CSR. The results also highlight the mediating role of consumers’ perceptions of congruence between their own characters and that of the company in their reactions to its CSR initiatives. More specifically, the authors find that CSR initiatives can, under certain conditions, decrease consumers’ intentions to buy a company’s products.

TI  - Perception of Ecological Risk to Water Environments
PY  - 1997
AB  - This paper examines lay and expert perceptions of the ecological risks associated with a range of human activities that could adversely affect water resource environments. It employs the psychometric paradigm pioneered in characterizing perceptions of human health risks, which involves surveys to obtain judgments from subjects about risk items in terms of several important characteristics of the risks. The paper builds on a previous study that introduced ecological risk perception. This second study employs a larger, more diverse sample, a more focused topic area, and comparisons between lay and expert judgments. The results confirm that a small set of underlying factors explain a great deal of variability in lay judgments about ecological risks. These have been termed Ecological Impact, Human Benefits, Controllability, and Knowledge. The results are useful in explaining subjects' judgments of the general riskiness of, and need for regulation of, various risk items. The results also indicate several differences and areas of agreement among the lay and expert samples that point to potential key issues in future ecological risk management efforts for water resources.

TI  - Price and Volume Effects Associated with Changes in the S&P 500 List: New Evidence for the Existence of Price Pressures
PY  - 1986
AB  - Attempts to identify price pressures caused by large transactions may be inconclusive if the transactions convey new information to the market. This problem is addressed in an examination of prices and volume surrounding changes in the composition of the S&P 500. Since these changes cause some investors to adjust their holdings of the affected securities and since it is unlikely that the changes convey information about the future prospects of these securities, they provide an excellent opportunity to study price pressures. The results are consistent with the price-pressure hypothesis: immediately after an addition is announced, prices increase by more than 3 percent. This increase is nearly fully reversed after 2 weeks. THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS (EMH) predicts that security prices reflect all publicly available information. Therefore, one corollary of the EMH is that "you can sell (or buy) large blocks of stock at close to the market price as long as you can convince other investors that you have no private information."1 This statement assumes that securities are near perfect substitutes for each other. If so, the excess demand for a single security will be very elastic, and the sale or purchase of a large number of shares will have no impact on price. In contrast to the EMH, Scholes [8], Kraus and Stoll [5], Hess and Frost [4], and others propose two hypotheses which predict that a large stock sale (purchase) will cause the price to decrease (increase) even if no new information is associated with the transaction. The imperfect substitutes hypothesis (ISH), also known as the distribution effect hypothesis, assumes that securities are not close substitutes for each other, and hence, that long-term demand is less than perfectly elastic. Under this hypothesis, equilibrium prices change when demand curves shift to eliminate excess demand. Price reversals are not expected because the new price reflects a new equilibrium distribution of security holders. The price-pressure hypothesis (PPH) assumes that investors who accommodate demand shifts must be compensated for the transaction costs and portfolio risks that they bear when they agree to immediately buy or sell securities which they otherwise would not trade. These passive suppliers of liquidity are attracted by immediate price drops (rises) associated with large sales (purchases). They are compensated for their liquidity service when prices rise (drop) to their fullinformation levels. The PPH, like the EMH, assumes that long-run demand is

TI  - How Much Does Size Erode Mutual Fund Performance? A Regression Discontinuity Approach *
PY  - 2010
AB  - The two main stylized facts in the mutual fund literature are that funds exhibit little ability to persistently outperform their peers, but that new money flows into funds with the highest past returns. The traditional interpretation is that fund managers are unskilled and fund investors are unsophisticated. Berk and Green (2004) offer an alternative, arguing that more-skilled managers will manage more assets but, because of diseconomies of scale, will generate the same expected returns as less-skilled managers. In their model, cross-sectional regressions of fund returns on fund size will significantly underestimate true diseconomies of scale. To identify the causal impact of mutual fund size on performance, we exploit the fact that small differences in mutual fund returns can cause discrete changes in Morningstar ratings that, in turn, generate discrete differences in mutual fund size. The diseconomies of scale that we estimate using this regression discontinuity approach are not statistically distinguishable from those estimated in standard cross-sectional regressions. Consequently, any downward bias in performance persistence arising from diseconomies of scale is likely to be small. (JEL classification: G23, G24, G14)

TI  - Investing for Impact
PY  - 2018
AB  - We study joint financing between profit-motivated and socially motivated (impact) investors and derive conditions under which impact investments improve social outcomes. When project owners cannot commit to social objectives, impact investors hold financial claims to counterbalance owners’ tendencies to overemphasize profits. Impact investors’ ownership stakes are higher when the value of social output is higher, and pure nonprofit status may be optimal for the highest valued social projects. We provide guidance about the design of contingent social contracts, such as social impact bonds and social impact guarantees.Received May 23, 2016; editorial decision April 28, 2018 by Editor Francesca Cornelli.

TI  - Do Funds Make More When They Trade More
PY  - 2017
AB  - We find that active mutual funds perform better after trading more. This time-series relation between a fund’s turnover and its subsequent benchmarkadjusted return is especially strong for small, high-fee funds. These results are consistent with high-fee funds having greater skill to identify time-varying profit opportunities and with small funds being more able to exploit those opportunities. In addition to this novel evidence of managerial skill and fund-level decreasing returns to scale, we find evidence of industry-level decreasing returns: The positive turnover-performance relation weakens when funds act more in concert. We also identify a common component of fund trading that is correlated with mispricing proxies and helps predict fund returns.

TI  - Defined Contribution Pension Plans: Sticky or Discerning Money?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Participants in defined contribution (DC) retirement plans rarely adjust their portfolio allocations, suggesting that their investment choices and consequent money flows are sticky and not discerning. However, participants’ inertia could be offset by DC plan sponsors, who adjust the plan's investment options. We examine these countervailing influences on flows into U.S. mutual funds. We find that flows into funds from DC assets are more volatile and exhibit more performance sensitivity than non-DC flows, primarily due to adjustments to the investment options by the plan sponsors. Thus, DC retirement money is less sticky and more discerning than non-DC money.

TI  - The Worst, the Best, Ignoring All the Rest: The Rank Effect and Trading Behavior
PY  - 2014
AB  - I document a new stylized fact about how investors trade assets: individuals are more likely to sell the extreme winning and extreme losing positions in their portfolio (“the rank effect”). This effect is not driven by firm-specific information, holding period or the level of returns itself, but is associated with the salience of extreme portfolio positions. The rank effect is exhibited by both retail traders and mutual fund managers. The effect indicates that trades in a given stock depend on how the stock compares to other positions in an investor's portfolio.

TI  - Salience and Asset Prices
PY  - 2013
AB  - In Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012a)— henceforth, BGS (2012a)—we described a new approach to choice under risk that we called salience theory. In comparisons of risky lotter ies, we argued, individuals’ attention is drawn to those payoffs which are most different or salient relative to the average. In making choices, individuals overweight these salient payoffs relative to their objective probabilities. A simple for malization of such salience-based probability weighting provides an intuitive account of a variety of puzzling evidence in decision theory, such as Allais paradoxes and preference reversals. Salience theory naturally lends itself to the analysis of the demand for risky assets. After all, risky assets are lotteries evaluated in a context described by the alternative investments available in the market. An asset’s salient payoff is naturally defined as one most different from the average market payoff in a given state of the world. We present a simple model of investor choice and market equilibrium in which salience influences the demand for risky assets. This model accounts for several time series and cross-sectional puzzles in finance in an intuitive way, based on its key implication that extreme payoffs receive disproportionate weight in the market valuation of assets. We focus on four well known puzzles. First, salient thinking leads to a preference for assets characterized by the possibility of high, salient payoffs that are overweighted by investors. One

TI  - Corporate Environmental Policy and Shareholder Value: Following the Smart Money
PY  - 2017
AB  - We examine the value consequences of corporate social responsibility through the lens of institutional shareholders. We find a sharp asymmetry between corporate policies that mitigate the firm’s exposure to environmental risk and those that enhance its perceived environmental friendliness (“greenness”). Institutional investors shun stocks with high environmental risk exposure, which we show have lower valuations, as predicted by risk management theory. These findings suggest that corporate environmental policies that mitigate environmental risk exposure create shareholder value. In contrast, firms that increase greenness do not create shareholder value and are also shunned by institutional investors.

TI  - Risk as Analysis and Risk as Feelings: Some Thoughts about Affect, Reason, Risk, and Rationality
PY  - 2004
AB  - Modern theories in cognitive psychology and neuroscience indicate that there are two fundamental ways in which human beings comprehend risk. The “analytic system” uses algorithms and normative rules, such as probability calculus, formal logic, and risk assessment. It is relatively slow, effortful, and requires conscious control. The “experiential system” is intuitive, fast, mostly automatic, and not very accessible to conscious awareness. The experiential system enabled human beings to survive during their long period of evolution and remains today the most natural and most common way to respond to risk. It relies on images and associations, linked by experience to emotion and affect (a feeling that something is good or bad). This system represents risk as a feeling that tells us whether it is safe to walk down this dark street or drink this strange-smelling water. Proponents of formal risk analysis tend to view affective responses to risk as irrational. Current wisdom disputes this view. The rational and the experiential systems operate in parallel and each seems to depend on the other for guidance. Studies have demonstrated that analytic reasoning cannot be effective unless it is guided by emotion and affect. Rational decision making requires proper integration of both modes of thought. Both systems have their advantages, biases, and limitations. Now that we are beginning to understand the complex interplay between emotion and reason that is essential to rational behavior, the challenge before us is to think creatively about what this means for managing risk. On the one hand, how do we apply reason to temper the strong emotions engendered by some risk events? On the other hand, how do we infuse needed “doses of feeling” into circumstances where lack of experience may otherwise leave us too “coldly rational”? This article addresses these important questions.

TI  - Do institutional investors drive corporate social responsibility? International evidence
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract This paper assesses whether shareholders drive the environmental and social (E&S) performance of firms worldwide. Across 41 countries, institutional ownership is positively associated with E&S performance with additional tests suggesting this relation is causal. Institutions are motivated by both financial and social returns. Investors increase firms’ E&S performance following shocks that reveal financial benefits to E&S improvements. In cross section, investors increase firms’ E&S performance when they come from countries with a strong community belief in the importance of E&S issues, but not otherwise. As such, these institutional investors transplant their social norms regarding E&S issues around the world.

TI  - The affect heuristic in judgments of risks and benefits
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper re-examines the commonly observed inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit. We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an ‘affect heuristic’ which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source—affective reactions to the stimulus item.

TI  - Demand Curves for Stocks Do Slope Down: New Evidence from an Index Weights Adjustment
PY  - 2000
AB  - Weights in the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index are determined by the market values of the included stocks' public floats. In November 1996, the exchange implemented a previously announced revision of its definition of the public float. This revision, which increased the floats and the index weights of 31 stocks, conveyed no information and had no effect on the legal duties of shareholders. Affected stocks experienced statistically significant excess returns of 2.3 percent during the event week, and no price reversal occurred as trading volume returned to normal levels. These findings support downward sloping demand curves for stocks. An obvious event with which to examine the slope of demand curves for stocks is one that changes supply. In the absence of new information, a shift in supply should not affect stock prices if demand curves for stocks are flat. Scholes (1972), using a sample of secondary equity distributions, asks whether stocks are "unique works of art" or merely abstract claims to residual cash flows with many close substitutes, as is assumed in much of finance theory. Scholes finds that the negative price impact of secondary offerings depends on the seller's identity-implying the revelation of unfavorable informationand rules out a pure supply effect. Mikkelson and Partch (1985), also using a sample of registered and unregistered secondary offerings, find weak evidence of downward sloping demand curves, but are unable to cleanly distinguish this explanation from the alternative explanation based on unfavorable information. A different class of events-additions to widely followed stock market indexes-ostensibly provides a setting where information effects should not be present. Shleifer (1986) documents a permanent price increase for stocks

TI  - Testing for Altruism and Social Pressure in Charitable Giving
PY  - 2012
AB  - Every year, 90 percent of Americans give money or time to charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing? We present a theoretical framework that pinpoints two types of motivation: individuals like to give, e.g., due to altruism or warm glow, or individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, e.g., due to social pressure. To distinguish the two types of motivation, we design a door-to-door fund-raising drive in which we vary the ability of households to seek or avoid a solicitor. Some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on the door-knob; thus, they can seek the fund-raiser if giving is welfare-enhancing, and avoid it if giving is welfare-decreasing. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 10 to 25 percent, suggesting that the average household seeks to avoid fund-raisers. Moreover, if the flyer allows checking a box for ‘Do Not Disturb’ giving is 30 percent lower. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than $10. These findings suggest that both types of motivation affect charitable giving, with more evidence supporting the social pressure explanation. Combining reduced form insights from these treatments with data gathered from a complementary field experiment, we are able to structurally estimate altruism and social pressure parameters.

TI  - Context-dependent preferences
PY  - 1993
AB  - The standard theory of choice—based on value maximization—associates with each option a real value such that, given an offered set, the decision maker chooses the option with the highest value. Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the “market share” of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent p...

TI  - Large Sample Properties of Matching Estimators for Average Treatment Effects
PY  - 2006
AB  - Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N 1/2 -consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N 1/2 -consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N 1/2 -consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Psychological evidence and casual intuition predict that sunny weather is associated with upbeat mood. This paper examines the relationship between morning sunshine in the city of a country's leading stock exchange and daily market index returns across 26 countries from 1982 to 1997. Sunshine is strongly significantly correlated with stock returns. After controlling for sunshine, rain and snow are unrelated to returns. Substantial use of weather-based strategies was optimal for a trader with very low transactions costs. However, because these strategies involve frequent trades, fairly modest costs eliminate the gains. These findings are difficult to reconcile with fully rational price setting.

TI  - Socially responsible firms
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the corporate finance tradition, starting with Berle and Means (1932), corporations should generally be run to maximize shareholder value. The agency view of corporate social responsibility (CSR) considers CSR an agency problem and a waste of corporate resources. Given our identification strategy by means of an instrumental variable approach, we find that well-governed firms that suffer less from agency concerns (less cash abundance, positive pay-for-performance, small control wedge, strong minority protection) engage more in CSR. We also find that a positive relation exists between CSR and value and that CSR attenuates the negative relation between managerial entrenchment and value.

TI  - Do Demand Curves for Stocks Slope Down
PY  - 1986
AB  - Since September, 1976, stocks newly included into the Standard and Poor's 500 Index have earned a significant positive abnormal return at the announcement of the inclusion. This return does not disappear for at least ten days after the inclusion. The returns are positively related to measures of buying by index funds, consistent with the hypothesis that demand curves for stocks slope down. The returns are not related to S & P's bond ratings, which is inconsistent with a plausible version of the hypothesis that inclusion is a certification of the quality of the stock.

TI  - Salience and Consumer Choice
PY  - 2013
AB  - We present a theory of context-dependent choice in which a consumer’s attention is drawn to salient attributes of goods, such as quality or price. An attribute is salient for a good when it stands out among the good’s attributes relative to that attribute’s average level in the choice set (or, more broadly, the choice context). Consumers attach disproportionately high weight to salient attributes, and their choices are tilted toward goods with higher quality/price ratios. The model accounts for a variety of disparate evidence, including decoy effects and context-dependent willingness to pay. It also suggests a novel theory of misleading sales.

TI  - Affect, risk, and decision making.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Risk in the modern world is perceived and acted on in two fundamental ways. Risk as feelings refers to individuals’ fast, instinctive, and intuitive reactions to danger. Risk as analysis brings logic, reason, and scientific deliberation to bear on risk management. In the present article, we examine what recent research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience reveals about risk as feelings and how it may influence judgments and decisions in cancer prevention and control. Background and Theory: The Importance of Affect Although the visceral emotion of fear certainly plays a role in risk as feelings, we focus here on a “faint whisper of emotion” called affect. As used here, affect means the specific quality of goodness or badness (a) experienced as a feeling state (with or without consciousness) and (b) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus. Affective responses occur rapidly and automatically—note how quickly you sense the feelings associated with the stimulus word treasure or the word hate. We argue that reliance on such feelings can be characterized as “the affect heuristic,” with the experienced feelings being used as information in the decision process. In this article, we trace the development of the affect heuristic across a variety of research paths followed by ourselves and many others. We also discuss some of the important practical implications resulting from the ways that this heuristic impacts how individuals perceive and evaluate risk and, more generally, how it influences all human decision making. Finally, we briefly discuss some important implications for communication and decision making pertaining to cancer prevention and treatment.

TI  - Regression Discontinuity Designs: A Guide to Practice
PY  - 2008
AB  - In regression discontinuity (RD) designs for evaluating causal effects of interventions, assignment to a treatment is determined at least partly by the value of an observed covariate lying on either side of a fixed threshold. These designs were first introduced in the evaluation literature by Thistlewaite and Campbell [1960. Regression-discontinuity analysis: an alternative to the ex-post Facto experiment. Journal of Educational Psychology 51, 309–317] With the exception of a few unpublished theoretical papers, these methods did not attract much attention in the economics literature until recently. Starting in the late 1990s, there has been a large number of studies in economics applying and extending RD methods. In this paper we review some of the practical and theoretical issues in implementation of RD methods. r 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measuring skill in the mutual fund industry
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Using the value that a mutual fund extracts from capital markets as the measure of skill, we find that the average mutual fund has used this skill to generate about $3.2 million per year. Large cross-sectional differences in skill persist for as long as ten years. Investors recognize this skill and reward it by investing more capital with better funds. Better funds earn higher aggregate fees, and a strong positive correlation exists between current compensation and future performance. The cross-sectional distribution of managerial skill is predominantly reflected in the cross-sectional distribution of fund size, not gross alpha.

TI  - Active Ownership
PY  - 2015
AB  - We analyze an extensive proprietary database of corporate social responsibility engagements with U.S. public companies from 1999–2009. Engagements address environmental, social, and governance concerns. Successful (unsuccessful) engagements are followed by positive (zero) abnormal returns. Companies with inferior governance and socially conscious institutional investors are more likely to be engaged. Success in engagements is more probable if the engaged firm has reputational concerns and higher capacity to implement changes. Collaboration among activists is instrumental in increasing the success rate of environmental/social engagements. After successful engagements, particularly on environmental/social issues, companies experience improved accounting performance and governance and increased institutional ownership.

TI  - Private Politics, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Integrated Strategy
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper provides a theory of private politics in which an activist seeks to change the production practices of a firm for the purpose of redistribution to those whose interests it supports. The source of the activist's influence is the possibility of support for its cause by the public. The paper also addresses the issue of corporate social responsibility by distinguishing among corporate redistribution as motivated by profit maximization, altruism, and threats by the activist. Private politics and corporate social responsibility not only have a direct effect on the costs of the firm, but also have a strategic effect by altering the competitive positions affirms in an industry. From an integrated-strategy perspective the paper investigates the strategic implications of private politics and corporate social responsibility for the strategies of rival firms when one or both are targets of an activist campaign. Implications for empirical analysis are derived from the theory.

TI  - Gaining Access by Doing Good: The Effect of Sociopolitical Reputation on Firm Participation in Public Policy Making
PY  - 2015
AB  - This paper examines the role of firms' sociopolitical reputations, as proxied by their perceived engagement in socially responsible practices, in public policy makers' decisions to grant access in the policy-making process. I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony, reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500 and find support for all three. These findings support the existence of a sociopolitical dimension to firms' reputations that affects how public policy makers evaluate firms, demonstrating that corporate social responsibility pays political benefits.

TI  - Economic Perspectives on Corporate Social Responsibility
PY  - 2012
AB  - *This paper synthesizes the expanding corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature. We define CSR from an economic perspective and develop a CSR taxonomy that connects disparate approaches to the subject. We explore whether CSR should exist and investigate conditions when CSR may produce higher welfare than other public good provision channels. We also explore why CSR does exist. Here, we integrate theoretical predictions with empirical findings from economic and noneconomic sources. We find limited systematic empirical evidence in favor of CSR mechanisms related to induced innovation, moral hazard, shareholder preferences, or labor markets. In contrast, we uncover consistent empirical evidence in favor of CSR mechanisms related to consumer markets, private politics, and public politics. (JEL D21, L21, M14)

TI  - Bias-Corrected Matching Estimators for Average Treatment Effects
PY  - 2011
AB  - In Abadie and Imbens (2006), it was shown that simple nearest-neighbor matching estimators include a conditional bias term that converges to zero at a rate that may be slower than N1/2. As a result, matching estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general. In this article, we propose a bias correction that renders matching estimators N1/2-consistent and asymptotically normal. To demonstrate the methods proposed in this article, we apply them to the National Supported Work (NSW) data, originally analyzed in Lalonde (1986). We also carry out a small simulation study based on the NSW example. In this simulation study, a simple implementation of the bias-corrected matching estimator performs well compared to both simple matching estimators and to regression estimators in terms of bias, root-mean-squared-error, and coverage rates. Software to compute the estimators proposed in this article is available on the authors’ web pages (http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/imbens/software.html) and documented in Aba...

TI  - Doing Well by Doing Good: The Benevolent Halo of Corporate Social Responsibility
PY  - 2015
AB  - Corporate social responsibility is commonly viewed solely as a tool for enhancing company reputations and engendering goodwill among customers. In contrast, this research shows that the impact of corporate social responsibility can extend beyond public relations and customer goodwill to influence the way consumers evaluate a company’s products. Specifically, this research documents that acts of social goodwill—even when they are unrelated to the company’s core business, as in the case of charitable giving—can alter product perceptions, such that products of companies engaged in prosocial activities are perceived as performing better. More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company’s prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company’s motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company’s behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence. By documenting that social goodwill can benefit consumer perceptions of product performance, these findings show that doing good can indeed translate into doing well.

TI  - Familiarity Breeds Investment
PY  - 2001
AB  - Shareholders of a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) tend to live in the area which it serves, and an RBOC’s customers tend to hold its shares rather than other RBOCs’ equity. The geographic bias of the RBOC investors is closely related to the general tendency of households’ portfolios to be concentrated, of employees’ tendency to own their employers’ stocks in their retirement accounts, and to the home country bias in the international arena. Together, these phenomena provide compeling evidence that people invest in the familiar while often ignoring the principles of portfolio theory. Traditional economic models posit investors who have beliefs about future payoffs of assets. Each investor selects his portfolio so as to maximize the expected utility of the portfolio’s payoff. Investors’ aversion to risk implies that their portfolios should be diversified. In particular, they will greatly benefit from international diversification. Nonetheless, people tend to ignore this advice: by and large, investors’ money stays in their home countries. Kang and Stulz (1997) observe: “Many Financial Economists have noticed that even though the barriers to international investment have fallen dramatically, foreign ownership of shares is still extremely limited and much smaller than one would expect in the absence of barriers to international investment.” An article in the Economist (1996), “Stay-at-Home Shareholders,” concludes: “It appears, therefore, that foreign investment has been hampered, at least until recently, by many of the factors that common sense would suggest: capital controls, opaque markets, and the high cost for fund managers of setting up overseas. In the past few years, these barriers have been falling—especially in emerging markets, where the gains from diversifying are biggest. So investors should soon start gobbling up foreign shares in record numbers. If they do not, economists may have to diversify into other theories.” This article offers a novel explanation of the home country bias: people simply prefer to invest in the familiar. People root for the home team, and feel comfortable investing their money in a business that is visible to them. Paucity of international diversification is only one of the implications of this tendency to invest in the familiar.

TI  - It's Good to be First: Order Bias in Reading and Citing NBER Working Papers
PY  - 2017
AB  - When choices are made from ordered lists, individuals can exhibit biases toward selecting certain options as a result of the ordering. We examine this phenomenon in the context of consumer response to the ordering of economics papers in an e-mail announcement issued by the NBER. We show that despite the effectively random list placement, papers listed first each week are about 30% more likely to be viewed, downloaded, and subsequently cited. We suggest that a model of “skimming” behavior, where individuals focus on the first few papers in the list due to time constraints, would be most consistent with our findings.

TI  - The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments.
PY  - 1977
AB  - Although the halo effect is one of the oldest and most widely known of psychological phenomena, surprisingly little is known about its nature. The halo effect is generally defined as the influence of a global evaluation on evaluations of individual attributes of a person, but this definition is imprecise with respect to the strength and character of the influence. At one extreme, the halo effect might be due simply to an extrapolation from a general impression to unknown attributes. Global evaluations might color presumptions about specific traits or influence interpretation of the meaning or affective value of ambiguous trait information. Thus, if we like a person, we often assume that those attributes of the person about which we know little are also favorable. (Politicians often seem to capitalize on this tendency by appearing warm and friendly but saying little about the issues.) Such a phenomenon could best be described as a de

TI  - Attentive Turkers: MTurk participants perform better on online attention checks than do subject pool participants
PY  - 2015
AB  - Participant attentiveness is a concern for many researchers using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Although studies comparing the attentiveness of participants on MTurk versus traditional subject pool samples have provided mixed support for this concern, attention check questions and other methods of ensuring participant attention have become prolific in MTurk studies. Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation. These results have implications for the sustainable use of MTurk samples for social science research and for the conclusions drawn from research with MTurk and college subject pool samples.

TI  - Seeing the world through GREEN-tinted glasses: Green consumption values and responses to environmentally friendly products
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract The primary goal of this research is to conceptualize and develop a scale of green consumption values, which we define as the tendency to express the value of environmental protection through one's purchases and consumption behaviors. Across six studies, we demonstrate that the six-item measure we develop (i.e., the GREEN scale) can be used to capture green consumption values in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious manner. We further theorize and empirically demonstrate that green consumption values are part of a larger nomological network associated with conservation of not just environmental resources but also personal financial and physical resources. Finally, we demonstrate that the GREEN scale predicts consumer preference for environmentally friendly products. In doing so, we demonstrate that stronger green consumption values increase preference for environmentally friendly products through more favorable evaluations of the non-environmental attributes of these products. These results have important implications for consumer responses to the growing number of environmentally friendly products.

We analyze this question for the case where shareholders are prosocial and externalities are not perfectly separable from production decisions. We argue that maximization of shareholder welfare is not the same as maximization of market value. We propose that company and asset managers should pursue policies consistent with the preferences of their investors. Voting by shareholders on corporate policy is one way to achieve this.

AB  - Three reasons are often cited for why corporate social responsibility is valuable: product quality signalling, delegated giving, and the halo eect. Previous tests focus consumers and cannot easily separate these channels because consumers are aected by all three. We focus on prosecutors, who are only susceptible to the halo eect. Using prosecutions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), we find that more socially responsible firms pay $2.3 million or 40% less than the median fine for bribery. We use the FCPA’s unexpected increase in enforcement to address reverse causality and text-mining of case files to reveal prosecutorial sentiment.

TI  - The Dividend Disconnect
PY  - 2019
AB  - Many individual investors, mutual funds, and institutions trade as if dividends and capital gains are disconnected attributes, not fully appreciating that dividends result in price decreases. Behavioral trading patterns (e.g., the disposition effect) are driven by price changes instead of total returns. Investors rarely reinvest dividends, and trade as if dividends are a separate, stable income stream. Analysts fail to account for the effect of dividends on price, leading to optimistic price forecasts for dividend‐paying stocks. Demand for dividends is systematically higher in periods of low interest rates and poor market performance, leading to lower returns for dividend‐paying stocks.

AB  - This article employs the 1975-84 quarterly holdings of a sample of mutual funds to construct an estimate of their gross returns. This sample, which is not subject to survivorship bias, is used in conjunction with a sample that contains the actual (net) returns of the mutual funds. In addition to allowing the authors to estimate the bias in measured performance that is due to the survival requirement and to estimate total transaction costs, the sample is used to test for the existence of abnormal performance. The tests indicate that the risk-adjusted gross returns of some funds were significantly positive. Copyright 1989 by the University of Chicago.

TI  - The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms
PY  - 2007
AB  - Despite a long tradition of effectiveness in laboratory tests, normative messages have had mixed success in changing behavior in field contexts, with some studies showing boomerang effects. To test a theoretical account of this inconsistency, we conducted a field exper- iment in which normative messages were used to promote householdenergyconservation.Aspredicted,adescriptive normative message detailing average neighborhood usage produced either desirable energy savings or the undesir- able boomerang effect, depending on whether households were already consuming at a low or high rate. Also as predicted, adding an injunctive message (conveying social approval or disapproval) eliminated the boomerang effect. The results offer an explanation for the mixed success of persuasive appeals based on social norms and suggest how such appeals should be properly crafted.

It is the discrete change in the star rating itself and not the change in the underlying performance measures that drives frow. We document econnomically and statistically significant positive abnormal flow following rating upgrades, and negative abnormal flow following rating downgrades. In contrast to the cross-sectional flow performance literature, we find evidence of investor punishment of performance declines, some of which is evident immediately in the month of the rating change.

Using the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut, which increased after-tax insider ownership, we find that firms with moderate levels of insider ownership cut CSR by more than firms with low levels (where the tax cut has no effect) and high levels (where agency is less of an issue). Moderate insider-ownership firms experienced larger increases in valuation. Similar insights hold in a regression-discontinuity design of close votes on shareholder-governance proposals. Individuals did not offset CSR cuts with private giving, suggesting a trade-off between governance and public goods.

TI  - Risk Aversion Or Myopia? Choices in Repeated Gambles and Retirement Investments
PY  - 1999
AB  - We study how decision makers choose when faced with multiple plays of a gamble or investment. When evaluating multiple plays of a simple mixed gamble, a chance to win x or lose y, subjects show a sensitivity to the amount to lose on a single trial, holding the distribution of returns for the portfolio constant; that is, they display "myopic loss aversion." Many subjects who decline multiple plays of such a gamble will accept it when shown the resulting distribution. This analysis is applied to the problem of retirement investing. We show that workers invest more of their retirement savings in stocks if they are shown long-term (rather than one-year) rates of return.

TI  - Maximizing Business Returns to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): The Role of CSR Communication
PY  - 2010
AB  - By engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, companies can not only generate favorable stakeholder attitudes and better support behaviors (e.g. purchase, seeking employment, investing in the company), but also, over the long run, build corporate image, strengthen stakeholder–company relationships, and enhance stakeholders' advocacy behaviors. However, stakeholders' low awareness of and unfavorable attributions towards companies' CSR activities remain critical impediments in companies' attempts to maximize business benefits from their CSR activities, highlighting a need for companies to communicate CSR more effectively to stakeholders. In light of these challenges, a conceptual framework of CSR communication is presented and its different aspects are analyzed, from message content and communication channels to company- and stakeholder-specific factors that influence the effectiveness of CSR communication.

TI  - Program Evaluation and Research Designs
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract This chapter provides a selective review of some contemporary approaches to program evaluation. One motivation for our review is the recent emergence and increasing use of a particular kind of “program” in applied microeconomic research, the so-called Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design of Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) . We organize our discussion of these various research designs by how they secure internal validity: in this view, the RD design can been seen as a close “cousin” of the randomized experiment. An important distinction which emerges from our discussion of “heterogeneous treatment effects” is between ex post (descriptive) and ex ante (predictive) evaluations; these two types of evaluations have distinct, but complementary goals. A second important distinction we make is between statistical statements that are descriptions of our knowledge of the program assignment process and statistical statements that are structural assumptions about individual behavior. Using these distinctions, we examine some commonly employed evaluation strategies, and assess them with a common set of criteria for “internal validity”, the foremost goal of an ex post evaluation. In some cases, we also provide some concrete illustrations of how internally valid causal estimates can be supplemented with specific structural assumptions to address “external validity”: the estimate from an internally valid “experimental” estimate can be viewed as a “leading term” in an extrapolation for a parameter of interest in an ex ante evaluation.
